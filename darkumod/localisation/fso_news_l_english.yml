 fsonews.1.t:0 "Friendship Union Joins Comintern"
 fsonews.1.d:0 "Official sources state that today the diplomats from the Friendship Union and Soviet Union signed a treaty effectively listing the former as a military ally and a member of Comintern. Such a change in the balance of power in Europe will surely increase the Soviet influence in the West and empower the communist movement as a whole. Leader of Germany, Adolf Hitler, states in a speech: 'This pact is threatening safety and security of Europe as a whole and, more importantly, the safety and security of Germany, german people. We will not stand idle and watch.'"
