 fsonews.1.t:0 "Friendship Union Joins Comintern"
 fsonews.1.d:0 "Official sources state that today the diplomats from the Friendship Union and Soviet Union signed a treaty effectively listing the former as a military ally and a member of Comintern.\n\nSuch a change in the balance of power in Europe will surely increase the Soviet influence in the West and empower the communist movement as a whole. Leader of Germany, Adolf Hitler, states in a speech: 'This pact is threatening safety and security of Europe as a whole and, more importantly, the safety and security of Germany, german people. We will not stand idle and watch.'"
 fsonews.1.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.1.b:0 "The germans cower!"
 fsonews.1.c:0 "We have nothing to fear from the Germans under the Bear's protection."
 fsonews.2.t:0 "Leon Trotsky Finds a Safe Haven"
 fsonews.2.d:0 "Information is spreading about the exiled soviet politician Leon Trotsky. It has been confirmed today that he has found safety in the fledgeling Friendship Union.\n\nWhether or not this will cause turbulence in the Prague-Moscow relations remains unclear, but the Supreme Leader of Friendship Union speaks openly against Stalin's policies."
 fsonews.2.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.2.b:0 "They will pay for sheltering that fool!"
 fsonews.2.c:0 "Sovets would not dare attack us!"
 fsonews.3.t:0 "Military Intervention In Austria"
 fsonews.3.d:0 "Today official sources in Austria have confirmed that the conflict with the Friendship Union was not a mere border war as was stated previously by [AUS.GetNeutralParty]'s leader. Elite forces of the Friendship Union were seen in Vienna and Graz, securing key infrastructure while a communist government established itself in the parliament.\n\nThe new Austrian leader, [AUS.GetLeader], is a staunch follower of Cutie-Marxism and proclaims eternal friendship with the Supreme Leader Dark Buddhist. It seems that the German plans in that region are now completely thwarted, and Berlin will almost certainly not be happy. This spread of communist ideas in Central Europe also concerns other major nations such as Italy and Britain."
 fsonews.3.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.3.b:0 "No longer a German puppet!"
 fsonews.3.c:0 "Friendship is unstoppable!"
 fsonews.4.t:0 "Friendship Union And German Reich Pact"
 fsonews.4.d:0 "In a somewhat surprising communique from Berlin today, the Reichschancellery states that in light of unannounced 'recent developments' the German Reich has reconsidered its approach to the fledgeling Friendship Union.\n\nThe message mentions a delegation of diplomats from the latter, and a special treaty 'Of Spheres Of Influence In Central Europe' signed between the two powers. For the past few days, the German aggressive rhetoric towards former Czechoslovakia and talks of claims over Sudetenland have subsided into nothingness, and it seems that at least for now this region will see peace and stability."
 fsonews.4.a:0 "I believe it is peace for our time."
 fsonews.5.t:0 "Friendship Union Manifests Destiny"
 fsonews.5.d:0 "Today in a radio announcement the Supreme Leader Dark Buddhist held a speech for the people of Friendship Union, proclaiming that their recent successes and expansion is proof of the righteousness of their 'Cutie Crusade', mentioning also the fact that there are still states left in Europe that do not comply with the same ideology. He urged his 'friends and allies' to 'muster the forces and gather the armies' for the 'coming liberation of the enchained'.\n\nThis is definitely an aggressive speech indicative of the expansionist intent, and only time will tell what comes of this."
 fsonews.5.a:0 "Interesting times."
 fsonews.5.b:0 "We will bury them!"
 fsonews.5.c:0 "We will fight to the last!"
 fsonews.6.t:0 "United Union of Unions Forms"
 fsonews.6.d:0 "The news of the Soviet Union's capitulation are still fresh, when today we are hit with another news!\n\nThe new regime installed by the Supreme Leader Dark Buddhist is gaining a lot of popularity across the former Soviet territory, with people praising 'just and wise' rulership. The formal allies of Friendship Union have also been lately talking about a possible formation of 'cutie-marxist superstate'.\n\nFinally, today Dark Buddhist proclaimed the integration of all controlled and allied territories of Cutie Marx Crusaders into United Union of Unions, a superstate spanning from Portuguese tip to Vladivostok. All are invited to join in a 'harmonious utopia of talents'."
 fsonews.6.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.6.b:0 "We are supreme!"
 fsonews.7.t:0 "Leon Trotsky Back In Power"
 fsonews.7.d:0 "Following Stalin's defeat, it seems like the power vacuum in the Soviet Union will be filled with ease. Comrade [SOV.GetLeader], Dark Buddhist's loyal aide and ideological ally, will lead the new Soviet Union 'on the path of just and proud talent seeking crusade', following the model of Supreme Leader Dark.\n\nThe new nation is going to be aligned completely with the Friendship Union and together they are likely to forge a new world order."
 fsonews.7.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.7.b:0 "Welcome back, comrade Trotsky!"
 fsonews.7.c:0 "Together to the stars!"
 fsonews.8.t:0 "Allied Powers Yield To Friendship Union"
 fsonews.8.d:0 "A string of defeats in the Middle East has led the Allied powers to the negotiations table with the Friendship Union. An upstart nation has impressed everyone with their swift and efficient blitz across the Balkans and into Syria and the Holy Land. A number of generals mentioned that they 'have never experienced fighting a foe so fierce before' in their lives.\n\nThe exact terms of the armistice remain disclosed, however observers state that they see Allied troops leaving the contested region beyond the Gaza-Sinai line into Egypt. Allied envoys have also reportedly left the courts of middle eastern countries, leaving them alone. The remaining leaders already announced a new defensive pact."
 fsonews.8.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.8.b:0 "It was a necessity."
 fsonews.8.c:0 "We have achieved a great victory today!"
