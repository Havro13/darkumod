 fsonews.1.t:0 "Friendship Union Joins Comintern"
 fsonews.1.d:0 "Official sources state that today the diplomats from the Friendship Union and Soviet Union signed a treaty effectively listing the former as a military ally and a member of Comintern.\n\nSuch a change in the balance of power in Europe will surely increase the Soviet influence in the West and empower the communist movement as a whole. Leader of Germany, Adolf Hitler, states in a speech: 'This pact is threatening safety and security of Europe as a whole and, more importantly, the safety and security of Germany, german people. We will not stand idle and watch.'"
 fsonews.1.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.1.b:0 "The germans cower!"
 fsonews.1.c:0 "We have nothing to fear from the Germans under the Bear's protection."
 fsonews.2.t:0 "Leon Trotsky Finds a Safe Haven"
 fsonews.2.d:0 "Information is spreading about the exiled soviet politician Leon Trotsky. It has been confirmed today that he has found safety in the fledgeling Friendship Union.\n\nWhether or not this will cause turbulence in the Prague-Moscow relations remains unclear, but the Supreme Leader of Friendship Union speaks openly against Stalin's policies."
 fsonews.2.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.2.b:0 "They will pay for sheltering that fool!"
 fsonews.2.c:0 "Soviets would not dare attack us!"
 fsonews.3.t:0 "Military Intervention In Austria"
 fsonews.3.d:0 "Today official sources in Austria have confirmed that the conflict with the Friendship Union was not a mere border war as was stated previously by [AUS.GetNeutralParty]'s leader. Elite forces of the Friendship Union were seen in Vienna and Graz, securing key infrastructure while a communist government established itself in the parliament.\n\nThe new Austrian leader, [AUS.GetLeader], is a staunch follower of Cutie-Marxism and proclaims eternal friendship with the Supreme Leader Dark Buddhist. It seems that the German plans in that region are now completely thwarted, and Berlin will almost certainly not be happy. This spread of communist ideas in Central Europe also concerns other major nations such as Italy and Britain."
 fsonews.3.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.3.b:0 "No longer a German puppet!"
 fsonews.3.c:0 "Friendship is unstoppable!"
 fsonews.4.t:0 "Friendship Union And German Reich Pact"
 fsonews.4.d:0 "In a somewhat surprising communique from Berlin today, the Reichschancellery states that in light of unannounced 'recent developments' the German Reich has reconsidered its approach to the fledgeling Friendship Union.\n\nThe message mentions a delegation of diplomats from the latter, and a special treaty 'Of Spheres Of Influence In Central Europe' signed between the two powers. For the past few days, the German aggressive rhetoric towards former Czechoslovakia and talks of claims over Sudetenland have subsided into nothingness, and it seems that at least for now this region will see peace and stability."
 fsonews.4.a:0 "I believe it is peace for our time."
 fsonews.5.t:0 "Friendship Union Manifests Destiny"
 fsonews.5.d:0 "Today in a radio announcement the Supreme Leader Dark Buddhist held a speech for the people of Friendship Union, proclaiming that their recent successes and expansion is proof of the righteousness of their 'Cutie Crusade', mentioning also the fact that there are still states left in Europe that do not comply with the same ideology. He urged his 'friends and allies' to 'muster the forces and gather the armies' for the 'coming liberation of the enchained'.\n\nThis is definitely an aggressive speech indicative of the expansionist intent, and only time will tell what comes of this."
 fsonews.5.a:0 "Interesting times."
 fsonews.5.b:0 "We will bury them!"
 fsonews.5.c:0 "We will fight to the last!"
 fsonews.6.t:0 "United Union of Unions Forms"
 fsonews.6.d:0 "The news of the Soviet Union's capitulation are still fresh, when today we are hit with another news!\n\nThe new regime installed by the Supreme Leader Dark Buddhist is gaining a lot of popularity across the former Soviet territory, with people praising 'just and wise' rulership. The formal allies of Friendship Union have also been lately talking about a possible formation of 'cutie-marxist superstate'.\n\nFinally, today Dark Buddhist proclaimed the integration of all controlled and allied territories of Cutie Marx Crusaders into United Union of Unions, a superstate spanning from Portuguese tip to Vladivostok. All are invited to join in a 'harmonious utopia of talents'."
 fsonews.6.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.6.b:0 "We are supreme!"
 fsonews.7.t:0 "Leon Trotsky Back In Power"
 fsonews.7.d:0 "Following Stalin's defeat, it seems like the power vacuum in the Soviet Union will be filled with ease. Comrade [SOV.GetLeader], Dark Buddhist's loyal aide and ideological ally, will lead the new Soviet Union 'on the path of just and proud talent seeking crusade', following the model of Supreme Leader Dark.\n\nThe new nation is going to be aligned completely with the Friendship Union and together they are likely to forge a new world order."
 fsonews.7.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.7.b:0 "Welcome back, comrade Trotsky!"
 fsonews.7.c:0 "Together to the stars!"
 fsonews.8.t:0 "Allied Powers Yield To Friendship Union"
 fsonews.8.d:0 "A string of defeats in the Middle East has led the Allied powers to the negotiations table with the Friendship Union. An upstart nation has impressed everyone with their swift and efficient blitz across the Balkans and into Syria and the Holy Land. A number of generals mentioned that they 'have never experienced fighting a foe so fierce before' in their lives.\n\nThe exact terms of the armistice remain disclosed, however observers state that they see Allied troops leaving the contested region beyond the Gaza-Sinai line into Egypt. Allied envoys have also reportedly left the courts of middle eastern countries, leaving them alone. The remaining leaders already announced a new defensive pact."
 fsonews.8.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.8.b:0 "It was a necessity."
 fsonews.8.c:0 "We have achieved a great victory today!"
 fsonews.9.t:0 "Friendship Union Emigrates"
 fsonews.9.d:0 "In an unprecedented operation, the Sudeten crisis was solved today by the combined effort of United Kingdom, Germany, Friendship Union and Soviet Union. The entire population, government and army moved into unpopulated territories of Argentina and Chile, although the capital area of Buenos Aires is now lost, too. President of the United States deemed these actions unlawful and unjustified."
 fsonews.9.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.9.b:0 "This is in violation of Monroe Doctrine!"
 fsonews.9.c:0 "We tricked them all!"
 fsonews.10.t:0 "Dawn of U.S.S.A."
 fsonews.10.d:0 "What could not be imagined merely a few years ago has come to be, as both American continents now stand united under the flag of the Friendship Union. To allow for easier and more efficient organisation, the Plebeian Assembly agreed to form a new state, the United Soviet Socialist America, which encompasses all of the New World territories."
 fsonews.10.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.10.b:0 "Truly a new era awaits!"
 fsonews.11.t:0 "Friendship Union Annexes Paraguay"
 fsonews.11.d:0 "Earlier this week the nation of Paraguay, where the communist revolution successfully secured the government, officially requested integration into the Friendship Union. The Plebeian Assembly immediately decreed this as an official act, indicating weeks of prior negotiation. This will certainly spread influence of the Union in South America."
 fsonews.11.a:0 "Para what?"
 fsonews.11.b:0 "Surely, no one even knows where Paraguay is on the map."
 fsonews.12.t:0 "Statue Of Equality Built In Rio"
 fsonews.12.d:0 "The ripples from recent reports of destruction of the statue of Christ the Redemptor in Rio de Janeiro have not subsided yet, and another report about this story is already in!\nIt appears that the Friendship Union and the Plebeian Assembly has decided to use the materials left from the statue to build their own. The new Statue of Equality depicts a worker raising his hammer high up in the sky, and the rumour says that the statue is intentionally poised to point towards New York. The official representatives in Nova Praha have denied these allegations."
 fsonews.12.a:0 "Is this some kind of cold war?"
 fsonews.12.b:0 "Ours is better!"
 fsonews.13.t:0 "Unprovoked Nuclear Attack On [fso_nuked.GetName]!"
 fsonews.13.d:0 "A shocking, disasterous tragedy! The Friendship Union, for the longest time a closed fortress of a country in the middle of Central Europe, reopened diplomatic relations - if you can call it that. A weapon of untold power has been unleashed on a peaceful territory in [fso_nuked.GetName] earlier this week. This unprovoked act of aggression has taken the world community by surprise, as even the Comintern denounced its ideological ally as 'despicable terrorists'. It is unknown as of yet why the attack was staged, as the leaders of Friendship Union have not made an official statement on anything in many months.\nDiplomats from all over the world are now gathering in Paris to discuss this unexpected horrifying threat to the safety of Europe and the entire world."
 fsonews.13.a:0 "The loss of life is devastating."
 fsonews.13.b:0 "But... they attacked us?.."
 fsonews.14.t:0 "'Atomic Bomb' Deployed By Friendship Union?"
 fsonews.14.d:0 "[fso_nuked.GetName], a country in a state of war with the Friendship Union, has made a press statement today describing a horrific act of war - a bomb of extreme destructive power was detonated earlier this week in a major city, and many thousands civilians have died in the blast. It is unknown, however, whether the attack was directed at the military, as the press release states the majority of the strike was directed at the population centers. In a passionate speech the leader of [fso_nuked.GetName], [fso_nuked.GetLeader], states that 'to defend the entire human race and civilisation, with all its core values and culture, we must unite against a common enemy which our nation has been fighting many years now'. The diplomats from all over the world are convening in the capital of [fso_nuked.GetName] to negotiate a united front."
