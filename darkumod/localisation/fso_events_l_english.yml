 fso.1.t:0 "Order 69"
 fso.1.d:0 "The people of Czechoslovakia have happily accepted the formation of a new nation, The Friendship Order. From all around the world people flock under the banners of a new country, seeking security and safety in these dark times. Under the leadership of Emperor Dark Buddhist, protected by his Praetorian Guard, the people feel a state of gaiety. The crowned Emperor's first decree is Order 69 - establishment of the Senate as the lawmaker body of the Order. The early days of a nation, however, are most turbulent, and who knows what time will bring..."
 fso.1.a:0 "Time will tell."
 fso.2.t:0 "Crowds Gather"
 fso.2.d:0 "The first Senate is now in session. But an unexpected issue appeared out of nowhere: a massive crowd gathered in front of the Senate, demanding to be let inside to participate!.."
 fso.2.a:0 "The Guards start letting the people inside..."
 fso.2.b:0 "Praetorian Guard starts beating the more vocal speakers in the crowd..."
 fso.2.c:0 "The Emperor graciously lets the people of the Order into the halls..."
 fso.2.dd:0 "Peetry shouts obscenities from the windows to driving the crowds away..."
 fso.3.t:0 "First Friendship Festival"
 fso.3.d:0 "Time of celebration! Emperor proclaims the first ever Friendship Festival. People are rejoiced and are having fun all across the nation! A group of military veterans approached Dark Buddhist and asked for permission to hold a grand military parade. It is all just for funsies, is it not?"
 fso.3.a:0 "It is the Friendship Festival! What could go wrong?.."
 fso.3.b:0 "Perhaps our plebs and Tribune can one up the militarists..."
 fso.3.c:0 "We must ask the crowd if they want to see the parade, first..."
 fso.3.dd:0 "Of course we allow the parade! What an excellent idea!.."
 fso.4.t:0 "International Recognition of the Order"
 fso.4.d:0 "The people seem content, however we are still ridiculed and gossiped about in other countries. To show others our friendly intentions, Emperor Dark Buddhist throws a massive party - and all the world leaders are invited! However, the Senate is split into camps, and all because they cannot agree on the main dishes for the upcoming party! The horror! It looks like the Emperor needs to step in."
 fso.4.a:0 "Tea and biscuits, obviously!.."
 fso.4.b:0 "Just let the Praetorian Guard cook something..."
 fso.4.c:0 "Sausages, pizza and Sushi for all!.."
 fso.4.dd:0 "Potatoes, bread and caviar, feed as many as possible..."
 fso.5.t:0 "The Dead Senator"
 fso.5.d:0 "During one of the post-session banquets in the Senate, one of the influential Senators was found dead on the street - it appears he fell out of one of the windows... or was this a murder? The public is in uproar, and all call for an investigation! The Praetorians secured the assumed murder scene, but whom will the Emperor appoint on such a delicate case?"
 fso.5.a:0 "Appoint a group of trusted military officers, veterans, Emperor's friends..."
 fso.5.b:0 "It is the Senate's business, let the Senate appoint investigators..."
 fso.5.c:0 "We can only trust the Praetorian Guard in this case..."
 fso.5.dd:0 "The Plebeian Assembly will appoint the investigators for this horrible murder..."
 fso.6.t:0 "The Dust Settles"
 fso.6.d:0 "The recent events forged our society and government in ways we could not predict. Now we are reaching the pivotal point of our nation's short existence, and the dust settles..."
 fso.6.a:0 "What do you mean?"
 fso.7.t:0 "Plebeian Assembly Supremacy Act"
 fso.7.d:0 "The Friendship Order has changed, and drastically so. The people, formerly supporting the autocratic (albeit fair and just) rule of Dark Buddhist, are now calling for measures to be implemented to transfer more power to the Plebeian Assembly. With widespread support and influence even in the Senate, and in light of recent events, the Assembly successfully pushed through the Plebeian Assembly Supremacy Act, giving it superiority over the Senate as the law making body. The Emperor is still formally in power, however, as the national love for him is ever present."
 fso.7.a:0 "Power to the people of Friendship Order!"
 fso.8.t:0 "Officer Corps seizes the Senate"
 fso.8.d:0 "Military influence is spread across the cities of Friendship Order. More and more people are criticizing the Senate for its divided nature, blaming more and more of daily problems on the 'lazy Senators in togas pretending to be Romans'. Playing off the nationalistic and militant tendencies of the public, the Patricii Officer Corps has seized majority in the Senate. The Plebeian Assembly is closed, and effectively now they can dictate the laws, and it appears that their definition of 'friendly' is rather perverted..."
 fso.8.a:0 "Freundschaft uber alles!"
 fso.9.t:0 "Peace and Stability"
 fso.9.d:0 "Despite the storm of recent events, the Emperor and his Guard have held onto the reins of power well enough. The Senate is functioning, Plebeian Assembly is more or less content, and the populace in general is happy. The radical tendencies are in decline, and people are now firmly believing in Friendship utopia under the visionary rule of Emperor Dark Buddhist. All Hail Emperor Dark!"
 fso.9.a:0 "Ave Imperator, Caesar invicta!"
 fso.10.t:0 "Of Liberties and Freedoms"
 fso.10.d:0 "The Emperor's attention given to the Senate has not gone unnoticed in the public. Farther and wider people are talking how great the Senate is and how noble the Senators are, how much they do for the people and the economy, protecting the nation's interests. Even the Plebeian Assembly has been cooperating with the Senate more than bickering. As a result, the Senate gained a lot more power, and the Order can now be properly called a democratic state. However, the role of Emperor Dark is still undecided under these new conditions."
 fso.10.a:0 "The Senate and People or Friendship Order are going to manifest their own destiny!"
 fso.11.t:0 "Emperor Bamboozled"
 fso.11.d:0 "The Guards allowed the people into the Senate halls under the choir of cheering crowds. The Senate, shellshocked and confused, immediately agreed to form the Plebeian Assembly, and it has gained immediate influence among the people, especially the lower class. Only time can tell what will come of this. The Emperor was greatly mispleased to learn of this."
 fso.11.a:0 "Surely the Guards should ask him first?"
 fso.12.t:0 "Bold Measures"
 fso.12.d:0 "Praetorians beat the more vocal orators down until the Emperor steps in, preventing the fight between the crowds and guardsmen. As a compromise, the Senate creates the Plebeian Assembly, which seems to have appeased the crowds enough. Regardless, there is a certain fear and minor stigma against the Guard now, and some members of our Officer Corps used this to secure personal influence, especially now that the plebs have quieted a bit."
 fso.12.a:0 "They are friends to the Emperor, it should not be an issue."
 fso.13.t:0 "Free People in a Free Nation"
 fso.13.d:0 "Benevolent as he is, Emperor Darku allows the people in. The crowds cheer and hail the Emperor's kindness. In a big ceremony the Senate officially creates the Plebeian Assembly, allowing plebs to participate in the law making process. This increased Senate's popularity somewhat."
 fso.13.a:0 "They better not forget who let them in in the first place!"
 fso.14.t:0 "Angery Doge"
 fso.14.d:0 "The cursing is so incredibly convoluted and offensive that the crowds are shocked. A few more brave ones muttered quietly "no u" and "your mum gay", but their voices are unheard. Confused crowds are just shambling around the square. Finally, the Emperor himself, escorted by the Guard, opened the Senate doors and let the people in. There, he formed the Plebeian Assembly to help the plebs represent their interests. The crowds disperse in peace and hail the wise Emperor."
 fso.14.a:0 "Peetry is a good Guard."
 fso.15.t:0 "Lenin Cake"
 fso.15.d:0 "Emperor allows the parade, however he decides to encourage the plebs to do something just as exciting. After consideration, Tribune and the plebs present their Festival attraction - a huge, massive cake with an even bigger Lenin on top! They move the cake through the streets of Prague with cheering and pony music mixed with Internationale. Crowds are ecstatic and will remember this event."
 fso.15.a:0 "The Emperor would like to get a slice of that cake."
 fso.16.t:0 "The Parade"
 fso.16.d:0 "Emperor Dark's enthusiasm inspired the veterans and officers, and they tried to make it as pompous as possible. All available military forces participated in it, and the crowds were allowed to parade alongside soldiers and military machines of war. It ended with an amazing air show of the entire Air Force. The crowds are filled with national pride now."
 fso.16.a:0 "We can direct it at our enemies!.. Wait, I thought we were friendly?"
 fso.17.t:0 "Parade Poll"
 fso.17.d:0 "Emperor privately addresses the Senate to help him solve the dilemma at hand. The Senate holds a nationwide poll asking for popular opinion of the parade. It does not really decide anything, because most people are indifferent to it. However, the Senate's popularity is now increased as they are viewed as the decisive force of action. The parade is now secondary in most headlines."
 fso.17.a:0 "The Senate? A force of action? Hah!"
 fso.18.t:0 "No Harm Indeed"
 fso.18.d:0 "Dark Buddhist allows the parade. At the festival, he attended many other events alongside of it, and although the crowds liked the impressive show of force, they were more interested in talking with their Emperor. The show of public support inspired Dark to travel more during the Festival. He has taken a great pleasure in doing so, and it is rumoured that he wants to make it a yearly occurence."
 fso.18.a:0 "The crowds, they love, they love me!"
 fso.19.t:0 "Potatoes and Bread"
 fso.19.d:0 "Being cheap products, the cooks managed to make and store lots and lots of bread and potatoes and feed a massive amount of people. The leaders of countries were also gorging on fine red and black caviar. The Soviet representatives especially were impressed with the sheer amount of bread and potatoes, and even asked if they could take a few tonnes home. Mao claimed he has never seen caviar before. Tannu Tuvan representatives, unfortunately, were forgotten about and had to be content with the same food as the crowds - however, nobody cared to notice. The diplomats seemed to have made a lot of time to meet the Plebeian Assembly members and the Tribune."
 fso.19.a:0 "They probably just shared some opinions."
 fso.20.t:0 "Sushi, Pizza and Sausages"
 fso.20.d:0 "Quality food made an excellent impression on all world leaders, however most impressed were the diplomats from Berlin, Tokyo and Rome. Emperor Darku, fascinated with Roman Empire just like the rulers of current Italy, conversed in Latin with the italian immediately appointed ambassador. Germany and soon after Japan appointed their ambassadors as well, and the rest of the world followed not long after the feast. Many words and promises of friendship of cooperation were exchanged, which visibly pleased the Officer Corps members present. Later they were quoting the Emperor on his comradery with the leading fascist powers."
 fso.20.a:0 "Germans, Italians and Japanese have a thing in common - good food!"
 fso.21.t:0 "Tea and Biscuits"
 fso.21.d:0 "A bit modest, but surely sweet, tea party held by the Friendship Order pleased the most attendees. Certainly, very much at home felt those from Britain, and the american diplomats politely supported their friends from London. Senators and diplomats talked a lot, and the latter shared a lot of wisdom and fun stories from their home parliaments. It seems that we have made a good impression on the inhabitants of Albion, as the news headlines would suggest on the following day."
 fso.21.a:0 "The Senate better not waste time on tea parties!"
 fso.22.t:0 "Praetorian Cooks"
 fso.22.d:0 "Definitely not the best choice, the Praetorians were not the greatest cooks! As such, the world leaders had to eat takeout ordered from the nearest restaurants. Luckily, the diplomats liked the presented food. To make the conference go smoother, the Emperor had decided to lead the diplomats to the restaurant closest to them. Such honour left the owners and personnel in awe, and later the word spread quickly about how close the Emperor is to the common business folk and working people."
 fso.22.a:0 "At least the world leaders were happy."
 fso.23.t:0 "Plebeian Police"
 fso.23.d:0 "The Assembly took the chance to solve this crime eagerly... perhaps, a little too eagerly. The appointed investigators brought their findings to Assembly, and the discussion that followed went well into the night. Finally, after a few days the Assembly and its investigation came to a conclusion: the senator was assassinated! In life he was a supporter of Tribune's rights, and as such the corrupt Consuls in the Senate could not allow him to live. They hired the killer, he threw the senator out the window, made it look like an accident... 'Just another act of violence by the oppressors in the Senate', they claim. The Emperor was not blatantly blamed in their statement, however he was criticized for 'allowing' this plot to go unnoticed. Both Senate Consuls resigned the following day, and are awaiting trial. The Assembly's popularity among the people is massively increased as a result."
 fso.23.a:0 "Suspicious..."
 fso.24.t:0 "Military Tribunal"
 fso.24.d:0 "The veterans' investigation proved to be thorough and dedicated. Upon completely inspecting the crime scene, talking to witnesses and analyzing clues, they reported to the Senate upon their findings. 'It is with a heavy heart we admit that he slipped on a slice of Di Giorno pizza and fell out the window', they said. 'However, we have evidence to show that the slice was left there with malicious intent by a man hired by the Tribune himself!' As this evidence they presented the money supposedly used to pay the man and the man himself - a sleazy looking fellow, who swore it was the Tribune who hired him to put the slice in the senator's room. The public is in shock. Tribune has immediately stepped down and was judged, the Assembly is furious, causing street riots over unjust accusations. The Emperor, realising the Guard alone is not going to be enough, calls on the Officer Corps to quell the riots. Military steps in and is regarded nationwide as saviours and keepers of Order."
 fso.24.a:0 "Well, their investigation seems legitimate..."
 fso.25.t:0 "The Senate's Investigation"
 fso.25.d:0 "Senatorial Board of Investigators - such is the official term for the team - is doing pretty much everything that the senators normally do - make a lot of speeches, give interviews, make a lot of noise, but they do not actually do a lot to solve the crime itself. 'It was most likely just an unfortunate accident', the official statement reads. Whether or not this is actually the case, we might never find out. However, the Senate has gained significant influence with the leverage of this 'investigation'."
 fso.25.a:0 "But what happened to the poor senator who died?!"
 fso.26.t:0 "Praetorian Investigation"
 fso.26.d:0 "Praetorians are trustworthy and competent, the Emperor considered. They conducted a thorough investigation of the event, the crime scene, interviewed all they could, but had to present a rather... Anticlimactic explanation. 'It appearts that he accidentally dropped a slice of Di Giorno pizza, and then slipped on it, which lead to him falling out the window'. Nothing happened as a result of investigation itself, but it would appear that the common folk is praising the Guard for their proffesionalism and express their belief that 'Praetorians keep us safe'."
 fso.26.a:0 "They are to be trusted."
 fso.27.t:0 "The Question of Monarchy"
 fso.27.d:0 "Glory to the people! Our transition of Plebeian Assembly into power was a success. However, the Emperor Dark Buddhist still formally leads the country. He has observed our actions carefully, weighing us. Some factions in the Assembly call for his removal as monarchy is opposed by Marxist teachings, but others wisely argue that the Emperor holds a lot of influence over the people still as their beloved symbol of friendship. The arguments in the Assembly continued, until finally..."
 fso.27.a:0 "...The radical faction won the vote! Plan the assassination!"
 fso.27.b:0 "...The negotiatiors gain the upper hand! Send the delegates!"
 fso.28.t:0 "Death of the Emperor"
 fso.28.d:0 "The murderers decided that the support of the people is enough to warrant a blunt approach without triggering a backlash. Rumours were spread that the Emperor plots to overthrow the rightfully established Assembly, and despite the Guard's and loyalists best efforts to thwart this, the belief was planted firmly. At dawn, the Palace was stormed by a massive amount of militia and the military. The Guards were overpowered by the sheer numbers and their resistance was neutralized by noon. The Emperor himself was captured in his bedroom, led out to the city square and executed under the chorus of bloodthirsty screams of the plebs. However, by the end of the day the conspirators were informed that Peetry, Emperor's brother, and the remaining Praetorians, accompanied by the remaining loyalists, fled to the south, where they gathered a potent force to 'liberate the nation from the murderous, fake news fagsies in the Assembly'. This marked the start of a civil war..."
 fso.28.a:0 "The people will prevail!"
 fso.29.t:0 "Ire of the People"
 fso.29.d:0 "The murderers decided that the support of the people is enough to warrant a blunt approach without triggering a backlash. Rumours were spread that the Emperor plots to overthrow the rightfully established Assembly, and despite the Guard's and loyalists best efforts to thwart this, the belief was planted firmly. At dawn, the Palace was stormed by a massive amount of militia and the military. However, the Guards resistance was enough to hold off the attackers long enough for the Emperor and his loyalists to escape. After the word of this reached Praetorians defending the palace, they escaped the city as well, leaving the conspirators empty handed. The crowds grumble, and worries are raised in the Assembly, although many believe that Emperor's escape only further proves his guilt. The fire of the civil war is now burning..."
 fso.29.a:0 "We will emerge victorious!"
 fso.30.t:0 "Monarchy Destroyed"
 fso.30.d:0 "The murderers decided that the support of the people is enough to warrant a blunt approach without triggering a backlash. Rumours were spread that the Emperor plots to overthrow the rightfully established Assembly, and despite the Guard's and loyalists best efforts to thwart this, the belief was planted firmly. At dawn, the Palace was stormed by a massive amount of militia and the military. Caught off guard, the Praetorians were neutralized within an hour, and the Emperor captured, as well as most loyal leaders and his brother Peetry. Later that day the Emperor was executed, crowds mixed with cheering and grieving for the loss of their Emperor. The remaining loyalists have dispersed with no real centralised opposition; all minor groups were suppressed and eliminated shortly. It seems that the transition of power is now complete."
 fso.30.a:0 "All according to plan."
 fso.31.t:0 "The Grand Conference"
 fso.31.d:0 "The negotiators launched a series of consultations with the Emperor, discussing the future of the Order with him personally and on the Assembly meetings. They were eager to discuss the teachings of Marx and Lenin with Dark Buddhist, and continually attempted to show him why they chose them. Eventually, the Emperor finally seemed to accept and see reason in the words of Assembly's finest demagogues. As a result, Dark was leaning more and more to a conclusion that the only way now for him to ensure the stability of this nation was to resign and distance himself from politics entirely, in seclusion away from the capital, surrounded by his loyal friends and supporters. While this was not quite what the negotiators had in mind, this was still an acceptable outcome to the question of monarchy, and enough to silence the more radical parties in the Assembly, and a popular option among the people, who saw the Emperor more as a formal ideal rather than a real force of power."
 fso.31.a:0 "We will keep an eye on him anyway, just in case."
 fso.32.t:0 "The Visionary Emperor"
 fso.32.d:0 "The negotiators launched a series of consultations with the Emperor, discussing the future of the Order with him personally and on the Assembly meetings. They were eager to discuss the teachings of Marx and Lenin with Dark Buddhist, and continually attempted to show him why they chose them. Eventually, the Emperor finally seemed to accept and see reason in the words of Assembly's finest demagogues. He was becoming more and more agitated and invested, and it would appear as he had started forming ideas of his own. The discussions became arguments, and through Dark's immense charisma and logic, the mentors became enthralled more in his vision of communist ideas, which Dark himself called 'Cutie-Marxism'. Finally, Dark held a speech in the Plebeian Assembly, which was broadcast by the radio across the country. He proclaimed his vision of the world as a union of friendship socialist states, explained the basics of Cutie-Marxism, and finished by accepting the Assembly leaders' invitation to lead the country as the Supreme Leader. This day will truly go down in history."
 fso.32.a:0 "The dawn of a new era!"
 fso.33.t:0 "Creeping Fear"
 fso.33.d:0 "The negotiators launched a series of consultations with the Emperor, discussing the future of the Order with him personally and on the Assembly meetings. They were eager to discuss the teachings of Marx and Lenin with Dark Buddhist, and continually attempted to show him why they chose them. However, no matter how hard they tried, these just did not sit well with Dark Buddhist at all. Worse, the intensity and frequency of invitations, discussions and meetings led to him growing suspicious and cautious. Then came allegations of dishonesty, then malicious intent, then, finally, accusations of treason. The negotiators were desperate, but it was too late. They could not influence the Emperor. One fateful day, the Praetorians stormed the Plebeian Assembly mid-session on the orders of the Emperor and demanded its closure immediately. Shaken by this, negotiators lost the initiative, while the radical factions eagerly took this as an opportunity. Militias and loyal military divisions surrounded the Senate's former building and besieged it, however, the Guards simply vanished before the encirclement was complete. The Emperor himself was long gone from the palace, and in a speech held from a radio station on the south of the country called for all still loyal to his name to gather and rally under the banners of 'true friends'. The civil war is now inevitable..."
 fso.33.a:0 "We tried our very best."
 fso.34.t:0 "Interesting Times"
 fso.34.d:0 "War! Civil war rages in our country now, and both sides are vehemently opposing one another. Let the dice fly!"
 fso.34.a:0 "We, of course, will be the victors."
 fso.35.t:0 "The Unrest Is Over"
 fso.35.d:0 "We have emerged victorious in the war, and now is the time to rebuild."
 fso.35.a:0 "Vae Victis."
 fso.36.t:0 "Into the Home of the Revolution"
 fso.36.d:0 "In this tense, aggressive world, our nation needs allies. Fortunately for us, our Marxist teachings are somewhat spread, and a very powerful Soviet Union would be likely willing to ally with us. The Plebeian Assembly formed the delegation, and they are ready to initiate negotiations with Moscow."
 fso.36.a:0 "We will show Comrade Stalin our devotion to the Revolution."
 fso.37.t:0 "Delegation from Friendship Union"
 fso.37.d:0 "Today Moscow receives guests from the Central Europe, where recent developments have led to establishment of a new communist state. The diplomats from the 'Plebeian Assembly' ask humbly to consider their membership in the Comintern. Surely, gaining an ally in the middle of Europe is beneficial and influential, however it may trigger aggression that we may not be ready for..."
 fso.37.a:0 "Communist friends? Of course!"
 fso.37.b:0 "We must focus on our own matters."
 fso.38.t:0 "Invitation to Comintern"
 fso.38.d:0 "After weeks of negotiations and conferences our diplomats were finally invited to attend the meeting of Comintern. At the meeting, Soviet representative spoke in favour of including us into the pact and offered diplomatic assistance in form of a military alliance. Rejoicing is heard among the people of the Friendship Union!"
 fso.38.a:0 "A toast for our Russian comrades!"
 fso.39.t:0 "Alliance Denied"
 fso.39.d:0 "Unfortunately, despite our diplomats' best efforts, Stalin and his leadership decided that helping us is too dangerous and puts Soviet Union into a forward position not necessarily welcomed by other European powers. As such, the delegation returns home empty-handed. The Plebeian Assembly's leader Ladifour in a speech held later that day announced creation of the 'Union of Friendly Socialist Republics' as 'a home and refuge to all those refused by their alleged comrades'. Other countries paid little to no attention, however..."
 fso.39.a:0 "Our people's will is stronger on its own."
 fso.40.t:0 "Autonomous Revolution"
 fso.40.d:0 "Glory to the Supreme Leader! Our strong and mighty Union still needs friends in this world. We have two options available: the Plebeian Assembly calls for a delegation to Moscow in an attempt to establish close ties to Stalin and Comintern, while the Supreme Leader is a fond fan of Trotsky's ideas. What do we do?"
 fso.40.a:0 "We will choose comrade Stalin and Comintern!"
 fso.40.b:0 "We will choose comrade Trotsky and Permanent Revolution!"
 fso.41.t:0 "Delegation from Friendship Union"
 fso.41.d:0 "Today Moscow receives guests from the Central Europe, where recent developments have led to establishment of a new communist state. The diplomats from the 'Plebeian Assembly' ask humbly to consider granting aid from Comintern. Surely, gaining an ally in the middle of Europe is beneficial and influential, however it may trigger aggression that we may not be ready for..."
 fso.41.a:0 "Communist friends? Of course!"
 fso.41.b:0 "We must focus on our own matters."
 fso.42.t:0 "Dobyvatel-Molotov Pact"
 fso.42.d:0 "After weeks of negotiations, our two great nations finally come up with an agreement that suits both nations' interests. It was ratified today by the Plebeian Assembly, Supreme Leader and comrade Stalin in a big meeting held in Prague. Comrade Dobyvatel signed the pact on one side and comrade Molotov on the other, offering mutual guarantees and defensive alliances, as well as a non-aggression pact. Celebrations were held in both capitals, and the world trembles."
 fso.42.a:0 "I knew we could count on Russians!"
 fso.43.t:0 "Moscow denies Friendship"
 fso.43.d:0 "Despite our best diplomatic efforts, Stalin did not agree to sign any pact that would suit us as well. It appears that we are alone in the world... for now."
 fso.43.a:0 "We will find better friends then."
 fso.44.t:0 "Trotsky Found"
 fso.44.tt:0 "We can now force government in other nations, as well as fabricate wargoals and declare war on other communists.\nHowever, we can no longer make puppets!"
 fso.44.d:0 "For months our agents seeked out Trotsky and tried to contact him. Finally, their efforts come to fruition, and today a plane brought the exiled politician to Prague. The Supreme Leader himself met him and invited to live in a big apartment in his Friendship Palace of the People, former Imperial Palace. Leon Trotsky seemed to be cautious and a bit suspicious, but eventually the Supreme Leader's attitude and security provided by the loyal military eased him up and he accepted the Supreme Leader's offer. A communique from Moscow demanded Trotsky's immediate exportation to Soviet Union for trial, but it was ignored by the Supreme Leader."
 fso.44.a:0 "Best Friends Forever!"
 fso.45.t:0 "Honouring Obligations"
 fso.45.d:0 "As per our new agreement we must guarantee independence of the Friendship Union."
 fso.45.a:0 "Stalin is a man of his word."
 fso.48.t:0 "Science Funding"
 fso.48.d:0 "Our prospering nation is overproducing! The excess goods are sold to our neighbours and comrades, and the state has made a profit. The surplus of funds was decided to spend on sciences, arts and sports funding, sciences being first on the list. It is up to our Supreme Leader to pick what do we spend the funds on..."
 fso.48.a:0 "Spend the funds on publishing my book to rival any other communist thinker!"
 fso.48.b:0 "To modernize, our nation needs a library, the biggest in the world!"
 fso.47.t:0 "The Great Library"
 fso.47.d:0 "The Great Library is complete, and all are in awe at the sight. Scientists and free thinkers from across the world are flocking to it, and research flourishes as a result."
 fso.47.a:0 "Excellent! Now if you do not mind, I'll spend my days there too."
 fso.46.t:0 "Cutie Capital"
 fso.46.d:0 "The book has been published! The money was spent to produce thousands of copies, and it has swept the minds of many. 'Every citizen needs to be allowed and supported in pursuit of his personal talents', Supreme Leader writes, 'thus we must search for people's talents'."
 fso.46.a:0 "Are we going to get any royalties?"
 fso.49.t:0 "Communist Culture"
 fso.49.d:0 "Next on the list are the fine arts. A new Art Excellence Committee has been formed and tracks the quality - and content - of all art created in our glorious nation. An effort is being made to help our populations' worldview transition to that of our Supreme Leader, and as we know, arts are the finest tools of mind conquering."
 fso.49.a:0 "To us, the cinema is a priority!"
 fso.50.t:0 "Fervent Plebs"
 fso.50.d:0 "The results of our arts funding campaign are astounding. Impressed and convinced in our great leader's vision, our people now realised how wrong the other leaders are. They seem to be more diligent and organised, which impacted our factories in a great way."
 fso.50.a:0 "The real Red Army!"
 fso.51.t:0 "Faster, Higher, Stronger!"
 fso.51.d:0 "Naturally, the fervor of our people has to be expressed. We are now investing a lot of resources into arranging various sports events, promoting healthy lifestyle, and our artists are helping in this regard quite a lot, providing posters and artworks."
 fso.51.a:0 "Communism empowers our people!"
 fso.52.t:0 "Fastest, Highest, Strongest"
 fso.52.d:0 "The campaign is paying dividends, and many more fresh recruits in excellent health condition flock to our conscription centers. Now our support is firm across the nation, and we can start our Crusade!"
 fso.52.a:0 "Elitest of elites!"
 fso.53.t:0 "Rebuilding Alone"
 fso.53.d:0 "Our war torn nation is in ruins. Moreover, our 'comrades' in the East have abandoned us as well. The people are gloomy and grim, but they believe still in our leadership, more than ever after the victory in the civil war. We must rebuild, and learn to survive on our own."
 fso.53.a:0 "We can trust no one, even other communists."
 fso.54.t:0 "Harsh Lessons"
 fso.54.d:0 "After weeks of hard labour, we are finally back in full force. We have rebuilt the factories and destroyed towns and the cities. Celebrations are held again for major holidays, and we can concentrate on immediate matters once more. Plus we have made significant advancements in our industrial technology, allowing us to repair easier in the future."
 fso.54.a:0 "We have to do everything ourselves."
 fso.55.t:0 "Comintern Aids Us"
 fso.55.d:0 "Our nation is ravaged by war, but we are not alone. We have to rebuild, but our new friends are helping us. With their assistance the progress is smooth and quick, and we are going to be fully restored soon."
 fso.55.a:0 "Comrades help other comrades!"
 fso.56.t:0 "Reconstructed"
 fso.56.d:0 "We have completed rebuilding, and we've asked to share some of their industrial technology with us - now we can repair more efficiently ourselves. However, the increasing Comintern influence in Europe is not unnoticed. The world community, whipped by the capitalists at helm, is imposing trade restrictions!"
 fso.56.a:0 "Curses!"
 fso.57.t:0 "Statue of the Supreme Leader"
 fso.57.d:0 "The people are quick to embrace the Supreme Leader as their ruler again, as he was loved by them before as well. An effort has been made by the commune of Prague to allow construction of a statue dedicated to Dark Buddhist. They asked him to let them know how big the statue must be built."
 fso.57.a:0 "Build a grand, magnificent statue!"
 fso.57.b:0 "Build a normal statue."
 fso.57.c:0 "Put a bust on a small pedestal."
 fso.57.dd:0 "Comrade Dark Buddhist does not need statues raised in his name!"
 fso.58.t:0 "Stalin is Not Happy"
 fso.58.d:0 "Our diplomats, currently in Moscow, report that after seeing the news about the new massive statue Stalin was very displeased. In frustration, he ordered a construction of an even larger statue, but the project was cancelled due to its costs. Stalin is, understandably, very unhappy with us."
 fso.58.a:0 "Ooof..."
 fso.59.t:0 "Comrade Stalin Approves"
 fso.59.d:0 "Reports from our diplomatic mission in Moscow suggest that comrade Stalin received the news about the statue with respect. He told one of the diplomats that 'moderation in all things is a key to success' and complimented our great leader on his humbleness."
 fso.59.a:0 "Supreme Leader is a paragon of virtue!"
 fso.60.t:0 "Moscow Reacts"
 fso.60.d:0 "Our ambassadors in Soviet Union contacted us recently and suggested that they are being ridiculed, humiliated even. The Soviet leaders are more condescending than ever, but at least seem eager and willing to 'aid our little comrades in Europe'. What comes of this in the end remains to be seen."
 fso.60.a:0 "At least we are closer to being actual communists."
 fso.61.t:0 "Cast Alone"
 fso.61.d:0 "Our defensive industry effort was a success. New technological advancements and agitational propaganda among the workers ensures flexibility in our factories and we've stored a lot of spare parts in case of requiring repairs."
 fso.61.a:0 "We have to do everything ourselves."
 fso.62.t:0 "Comintern Aids Us"
 fso.62.d:0 "Soviet advisors have completed the inspection of our industrial capacity, and they provided our engineers with many useful insights into factory structuring and replaceable parts. We've gained a massive surplus of parts and equipment from Comintern, but this has seriously concerned other nations of the world."
 fso.62.a:0 "We do not need capitalist trade anyway."
 fso.63.t:0 "Outcasts"
 fso.63.d:0 "We are all alone. Isolated. 'Cutie-Marxism in one state' is heard almost akin to a chant in the Plebeian Assembly, and people seem to be reflecting on this. The general opinion is that we, spurned by all, misunderstood by all, must forge our own path and close our country to the outside world."
 fso.63.a:0 "This is the way".
 fso.64.t:0 "Soviet Inspectors"
 fso.64.d:0 "A team of specialists from Moscow has arrived today to examine our factories and industry. They will serve here as advisors and help us gain a better understanding of improving our industrial power."
 fso.64.a:0 "Good, good!"
 fso.65.t:0 "Hopes for Tomorrow"
 fso.65.d:0 "Messengers with all sorts of pamphlets, manifestos and diplomatic offers left Prague this morning. The supreme leader himself visited the Plebeian Assembly and shared a toast to our newly found identity.\nThe people are joyful as well, seeing Assembly taking active role in legimizing our young communal nation. Nobody can tell, if diplomacy and relations will be enough, but hopeful spirit rules the day and at many places cheering turns to party."
 fso.65.a:0 "No party like a communist party."
 fso.66.t:0 "In the Dead of Night"
 fso.66.d:0 "Two months of silence were more then worrying. Not a single nation responded to our offers of friendly relations, yet the Assembly is keeping this fact from the public, for now. The supreme leader is often seen worried, looking from the palace window, obviously in a troubled state of mind.\nToday this would end. In the early morning hours, a secret delegation from Austria arrived to Prague and kindly asked to see the Supreme leader personally. Guards woke him up without hesitation and soon diplomats and Assembly representatives sat in a private room with their Austrian counterparts.\nSoon after, the Assembly rushed an early morning meeting and announced the news: some austrian politicians and prominent citizen ask us for a very bold move - to invade Austria and install our own government, in order to defend against the Reich together.* the * Delegation also argued, that we are but next in line, so cooperation only makes sense, but Germans already have way too much influence in Austria. A direct intervention is unavoidable, should we accept their offer. What should we do?"
 fso.66.a:0 "We need allies and they need us!"
 fso.66.b:0 "Risking a war with the Reich would be suicide."
 fso.66.tt2:0 "Picking this option will lead to us losing all guarantees.\n"
 fso.66.tt:0 "Germany will like us if we refuse. This can lead to further agreements later."
 fso.75.t:0 "A Day to Remember"
 fso.75.d:0 "Was there ever a more glorious sight? This morning, the Austrian parliament in Vienna got a fancy new look. The flags of the Friendship Union rolled out from the windows and our Cutie-Marxist Crusaders made sure to arrest every nazi sympathizer in the building. While the necessary work is being done and new people appointed, our sights are set towards the west - thats where the upcoming storm will come from, and it will come soon. 'Tis surely a glorious day, but there is no time to celebrate."
 fso.75.a:0 "We release the land as per our obligation."
 fso.75.b:0 "The new government can be trusted. We do not need to interfere."
 fso.75.c:0 "Welcome our new best comrades!"
 fso.67.t:0 "The Alpine Wall"
 fso.67.d:0 "Construction of a long line of defensive forts began today. All the way from Tyrol to Silesia, we are building together, Austrian, Czech and other workers as one, sharing resources and manpower. The Germans already addressed our newly formed friendship and made sure to make a few threatening speeches and are pressuring western powers to stay out of it. Would the Alps and mountains of the Sudeten be enough to keep the nazis out?"
 fso.67.a:0 "Death is preferable to being a Nazi subject."
 fso.68.t:0 "Defenses Are Ready!"
 fso.68.d:0 "Construction overseers came with some exciting news today: the whole defensive line is complete!\nFortification experts are still worried, though, pointing out that some areas are easier to push through than others and strongly suggested we consider building even better defenses at crucial spots across the borderline. \nMeanwhile, Austrian population is getting used to the new communist government and our Cutie-Marxist Crusaders are making sure that no bigger instability arises both at home and in Austria."
 fso.68.a:0 "Let them come."
 fso.69.t:0 "Unlikely Alliance?"
 fso.69.d:0 "With lots of effort and a little bit of ideological gymnastics, the Plebeian Assembly has managed to put together a proposal to the Germans, offering our support in their obvious upcoming political maneuvers, namely incorporating Austria into the Reich and supporting their claim on Danzig.\nOur finest diplomats are going to be sent today to Berlin, securing key relations with the Reichstag and making sure our own borders will stay secure."
 fso.69.a:0 "Will they accept?"
 fso.70.t:0 "Scratch My Back, I Scratch Yours"
 fso.70.d:0 "The long awaited response from the Reich has finally arrived. Current Tribune of the Plebeian Assembly, Ladifour, unsealed the letter in front of all plebeians, reading aloud the carefully worded acceptance of our proposal. The German Reich welcomed our support in their future endeavors and decided to sign a pact of non-aggression, promising to respect our national sovereignty as long as we support their moves.\nAfter the reading was done, a loud applause echoed the Assembly. Another victory for the Friendship Union!"
 fso.70.a:0 "Cunning diplomats, aren't we?"
 fso.70.tt:0 "Germany will now never Demand Sudetenland.\n\n"
 fso.71.t:0 "The Situation is Dire"
 fso.71.d:0 "Our nation is under attack! No one else will help us, but... we hear that the Friendship Union offers protection, this is our last chance!"
 fso.71.a:0 "HELP HELP HELP"
 fso.72.t1:0 "Out Of The Way"
 fso.72.t2:0 "Old Ties"
 fso.72.d1:0 "There is no way a free land can survive surrounded by bourgeoisie dictatorships.  Our commune is somewhat willing to take up arms and free the people of neighbouring nations, and the Assembly is about to pass the war planning order soon. Looking beyond the horizon, there is one ugly thing standing in our view - the nation of Hungary."
 fso.72.d2:0 "Most people alive still remember being one nation with hungarians, fighting the same wars, side by side, living together, speaking together, sharing common goals and common problems. Thanks to our common story, its not so hard to imagine being together once more, except this time as free folk and comrades!"
 fso.72.a:0 "Soon there will be no such obstacle."
 fso.72.b:0 "I hope they share some goulash."
 fso.73.t1:0 "Pest of Budapest"
 fso.73.t2:0 "Unbroken Promises"
 fso.73.d1:0 "Extensive landscape research was carried out, while a squadron of our slovakian spies scouted most of the northern cities of Hungary. Land owners and wealthy citizens of major cities are becoming worried, as nobody has fully pledged to protect them from the masses of enraged workers.\nPlans can be carried out whenever we wish. Workers are being silenced in this pitiful state, theres no other option than removing the ruling class by force."
 fso.73.d2:0 "Still bathing in glory and prestige, as we were the only ones to offer a helping hand to Austria while all the other big nations stood idle, The people of Hungary asked the same, and we obliged.\nThere was no real resistance from the upper classes, as the workers all across the country rose up and either let them surrender peacefully, or took them hostage. The last pockets of resistance still exist across the country, but rest of them were more than willing to put up a Friendship Order flag, when they saw the liberation army approaching."
 fso.73.a:0 "Together forever!"
 fso.73.b:0 "Blood for freedom!"
 fso.76.t:0 "The Cutie Speech"
 fso.76.d:0 "A passionate speech resonated both throughout the walls of the Assembly and within the hearts of all listeners. In utter silence, audience listened as if under a spell to the speech about an epic journey:\n'How long will we hold the jewels of our newfound freedom just for ourselves and our kin? How long will we act like the Soviets, just waiting around, whilst lower classes suffer all around the globe? Comrades, I can't watch people being enslaved for work for their masters, being dehumanized to a level of mere cattle. My friends, it is time for us to strike at the heart of the corrupt machinery, and travel far, freeing all peoples on the way.'\n'Iam a crusader, and a son of Marx. I say, one last war to end all wars! One last blood to save all! One last crusade, to connect all... So who's with me?!' - shouted the Supreme Leader.\n'I am a crusader!' - yelled back, cutting through the silence, one of the plebeians. 'Iam a crusader!' - stood up another.\nAnd just like that, war fervour quickly spread all across Prague. The crusade is about to begin!"
 fso.77.t:0 "Cocked And Ready!"
 fso.77.d:0 "With the vanguard well armed and prepared, the rising sun is on the horizon. The finest creative minds of our lands put together revolutionary designs of cutie crusader tanks and vehicles, while tireless and enthusiastic workers assembled the machinery. Was there ever a more beautiful sight than all working together, in preparation for the last crusade to free them all?\n'You must not forget who you are,' urged the Tribune. 'Dont leave a scorched land behind as you go, free all the people, preserve their homes, their fields! If there is one enemy, it is the rich and powerful demagogues. As you capture those monsters, dear comrades, do not fall down to their level, preserve the newfound wealth from being stolen, ravaged and destroyed. Distribute it instead among the locals! If we are to ever build a fair, loving society, we must show the best of us and be the ultimate inspiration for the people.\nNow good luck crusaders, and do not forget your task!'"
 fso.77.a:0 "To arms!"
 fso.77.b:0 "To arms!"
 fso.78.t:0 "Test of Time"
 fso.78.d:0 "It is one thing to take, to conquer, to burn down and destroy... and its entirely other thing to keep it all together.\nAs we seized the wealth and estates of the rich, except minor cases of theft and administration failures, it seems to be quite fairly redistributed with help of already existing structures. The ghost of war is still haunting the lands though, and the dust just barely settled. Victims and families of the fallen soldiers still endulge in passive or aggresive resistance and many functional errors occur everywhere.\nThe wisest of deciions has been made - to slow down, rebuild, nourish and integrate what weve already liberated."
 fso.78.a:0 "It is essential."
 fso.79.t:0 "A New Society"
 fso.79.d:0 "A single tear escaped the Supreme Leader's eye upon seeing the grand parade. People from all corners of our grand commune celebrating together, laughing, joking, feasting. Statues, public houses, schools and hospitals are rising all across the previously devastated lands and majority of the locals now see the light of communism. Now, they can finally live in peace, without the Damokles sword in shape of their former masters whips..."
 fso.79.a:0 "Share the feast equally!"
 fso.79.b:0 "Share the feast equally!"
 fso.80.t:0 "Final Preparations"
 fso.80.d:0 "The supreme leader Dark Buddhist leaned closer to the map of Europe laid on the big table in front of him, surrounded by his loyal generals. 'The Soviets are plotting against us, I am sure of it. They have been quiet. Too quiet.' He paused, as if thinking about something. But not a few moments later, continued. 'Comrades, war with the russian bear is inevitable. There can be only one Union. But for now... for now we must secure our position firmly in Europe. Prepare our army, for the final act begins.'"
 fso.80.a:0 "Glory to comrade Dark!"
 fso.81.t:0 "Dream of Power"
 fso.81.d:0 "This is total war now. An official proclamation today from the Palace of Friendship states that we as a nation must fulfill our destiny and become the most powerful state in the world, and unify Europe under one banner, our banner. The remaining independent european countries have pulled their embassies out of Prague, and let us know they will prepare for the worst."

 fso.82.t:0 "Into the Heart of Darkness"
 fso.82.d:0 "At last, our grip on Europe and beyond is unmatched. Our enemies lie in ruins, and our friends praise our leadership. People on the streets are chanting the supreme leader's name, women name their children after him, holidays are established on his birthday. Only one country so far has not been touched. One nation observed us from the side. One corrupt government. One failed state. A failed communist society, rotten to the core. We simply must intervene, We must save the suffering workers and farmers of the Soviet Union! Only a full conquest shall satisfy us!"

 fso.83.d:0 "The Soviet Union is defeated! The dictator Stalin and his corrupt government is overthrown, people celebrate us as liberators! The supreme leader declared an amnesty to all purge victims and those prosecuted by the old regime... replacing them in camps with supporters of Stalin.\nWe are now victorious, and our Cutie Crusade is complete!\n\nThis is the end of this story. Thank you for playing it to the end! You have officially won :D\nNow you can either continue playing this game and bring the world to knees or try a different path or branch - after all, there are many options and outcomes to try, and every game will be different as the Friendship Order!"

 fso.84.t:0 "A Peace Offer!"
 fso.84.d:0 "After a long series of offensive maneuvers we have finally overpowered the Allied forces in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine, as well as any of their aligned states. Our warpath all the way from our home in Prague to the hot deserts of Middle East is a shock to them, an unexpected, stunning defeat. Realising that they will not be gaining back any lost ground now as we have firmly garrisoned it, the envoys from London and Paris today arrived to see the supreme leader and negotiate peace. Together they worked out acceptable peace terms: end to all hostilities in return to our forces keeping our conquest, as well as promises of no further influence in the Middle East."
 fso.84.dd:0 "France only had a small garrison in Syria, and our army has pushed them out quickly. Without British support, there is no hope for France to ever reclaim these colonies. As such, the diplomats from Paris have today agreed with our supreme leader's peace terms: end of hostilities, transfer of Syria to us and no further influence in the Middle East."
 fso.84.ddd:0 "Without France and its large army, British could not defend all of their stretched out empire. Our troops have secured Palestine and Jordan, and firmly hold off any naval invasions or attacks. London has sent us an envoy with a peace agreement: British Empire will transfer the colonies to us and leave the Middle East with promises of no further influence in there."

 fso.85.d:0 "The long war in Europe, one of many, has subsided for now. All continental enemies capitulated, but still there are enemies across oceans of land and water. Realising that Europe is lost completely, they have sent us envoys with a peace treaty: they are willing to sign a separate peace and allow us to annex the europeans."
 fso.85.a:0 "They betray their allies?"
 fso.86.t:0 "Securing Our Future"
 fso.86.d:0 "Despite insurance provided by Comintern, our position as Germany's next door neighbour remains unstable. Germans in Sudetenland are almost up in arms, and they openly oppose our rule. It will not be long before this is used as a pretext for invasion by Germany... However, with massive economic support provided by Comintern we have come up with a plan - and the Germans will definitely help us with it too!.."
 fso.86.a:0 "It is a genius idea."
 fso.87.t:0 "Generallplan Czechia"
 fso.87.d:0 "The plan was executed perfectly. First, necessary negotiations were initiated in Munich. Delegates from London, Berlin and Moscow met and discussed the Sudetenland situation. What came out of it publicly was the Munich Diktat. However, in secret, the Germans, Russians and the British all agreed to help perform a daring scheme, nicknamed in Germany 'Generallplan Czechia'.\n\nOver the following months, hundreds of convoys filled with people sailed across the Atlantic Ocean, south, to Falklands, and then Argentina and Chile. Pressured by all three major power blocs, Argentina and Chile both simply followed the lead and were helpless as millions of Czechs populated the southern territories. Finally, the last of them have now crossed the ocean, bringing the might of the Friendship Order's Army, which secured Buenos Aires. Germany in the meantime secured the now deserted, empty Czechoslovakia, administrating the lands as they please.\n\nThe Plebeian Assembly now convenes in Argentina's former Parliament, and its government has fled northwards. The first edict of the Assembly on the new spot was renaming Buenos Aires to Nova Praha, and the city commune has been tasked with renaming every street now.\n\nThe United States, a major power so far playing by the rules of Monroe Doctrine, was most displeased, and the Congress is now in full opposition towards the United Kingdom. [USA.GetLeader] stated that 'caving in to the Germans is the likely thing the dying Empire would do.' They are not likely to simply leave us alone."

Most blaring obstacle in our path right now being that we are lacking in our industrial power, and the communications here are scarce.

New factories and roads are ready, and using the most advanced Comintern technology the facilities take less room, allowing us to build more compact industrial complexes! Our prospectors report steel veins were found in the mountanous areas we received, which should offset our loss of steel mines in Czechoslovakia. We have established an industrial base and can now consider further tasks ahead..."

 fso.90.t:0 "Comrades Or Enemies Of The People?"
 fso.90.d:0 "Over five million argentinians now end up living with us, under our rule, just like Slovakians used to be once. However, where once we were limited by being in the center of the world's attention, now we are remote and can practically do as we please... To a degree. Things do not have to be grim, however - we can always use more numbers, and Argentinians may prove to be useful allies should be convince them to join the right cause."

 fso.91.t:0 "Argentinian Question"
 fso.91.d1:0 "Over the past two months, a series of purges occured in and around former Buenos Aires. Thousands of argentinian families were executed, lynch mobs burned, raped and pillaged, and so did the soldiers of our army. But that was merely the first step of 'Buenos Noches', as this operation was called by our ideologists. The remaining Argentinian population under our rule was arrested and directed into work camps, where they were meant to die from excruciating and harsh work conditions, including but not limited to: barely any food, 12 hour work days, hard labour in quarries and mines, disregard of safety conditions for Argentinians, and so on. The 'enemies of the Friendship Union' was the official label of these people.\nAlmost religious fervour inspired in our non-Argentinian populace, caused by this avalanche of violence, has unified them and our government's military actions find a lot more support now that the blood is spilled.\nHowever, not all Argentinians were purged. Some of them managed to slip away from the country, and our gruesome genocide is now widely known. Argentinian government in exile has closed all diplomatic relations, and our trade with almost all of the remaining world is limited."
 fso.91.d2:0 "A series of laws were passed by the Assembly, granting various rights and priviliges to our Argentinian population. Within these past months, our society took a friendly approach towards them, and they now seem eager to be a core part of our armed forces. This will definitely cause more sympathizers to join our armies as we progress, but will make it easier for spies and saboteurs to infiltrate our ranks."

The police was guarding the streets from any possible dangers, but they were completely unprepared for what was about to come.\nAt 13:42, an unknown gunman shot a bystander. Immediately after the prepared agents in the crowd shouted and blamed the police nearby. Then, the communist militia disguised in the crowd started attacking the officers of the police, and as the police responded, in the chaos more people were shot. This infuriated the crowds, and they joined the militias, overwhelming the police. Brazilian government was forced to call upon the military, and they made just the mistake our contacts were anticipating: the hardline military commanders ordered fire against the mutinous crowds.\nThousands of innocents, caught in the line of fire, died on this day, and the communist militiamen among them knew they would die for the right cause. This became "The Red Carnival", an event that will go down in history as one of the bloodiest war crimes.\nThe fire of the civil war now burns in Brazil.

 fso.102.d:0 "As no other rival lies before us, we must push hard towards the north and confront the United States as soon as possible! Eliminate all opposition!"
 fso.102.a:0 "We are the light bringers!"
 fso.103.t:0 "The True Enemy"
 fso.103.d:0 "At last, we have secured the entire continent. The United States are shaking in their boots. In their anger, they do not know how to stop us. Today, the american army marched into Canada and a coup in Mexico overthrew the government, immediately requesting 'protection from the imminent communist threat'. The entire North American continent is now unified against the entire South American continent. North vs South again. And the South is going to win this time."
 fso.103.a:0 "The real South will rise!"
 fso.104.t:0 "End of USA"
 fso.104.d:0 "As was expected, we are victorious. The United States lie in ruins, and the communists who spent their lives in hiding from the federal government are now appointed to the new offices in our unified nation. Perhaps, we should consider adopting a new state structure?"
 fso.104.a:0 "United Soviet Socialist America? Sounds brilliant."
 fso.105.t:0 "A Statue Project"
 fso.105.d:0 "We are now in full control of Rio. The Plebeian Assembly pointed out the fact that the city houses one of the largest religious statues ever built - statue of Christ the Redemptor. It is an insult to our communist ways, and a faction of the Assembly wants us to dismantle it. A team of sculptors already proposed to use the materials gained in this way to build the Statue of Equality - a symbol of our supremacy, to rival the american statue of liberty in New York. The project now only awaits to be approved."
 fso.105.a:0 "You may fire when ready."
 fso.106.t:0 "The Church of Revolution"
 fso.106.d:0 "A group within our nation is gaining power rapidly. It is calling itself the Church of Holy Revolution, and it is gaining followers very rapidly. They have proclaimed Rio de Janeiro their holy site, and the city has grown to rival Nova Praha in influence because of them. Their teachings attract many as the early Christianity attracted people in the Roman Empire, promising social equality, peace, harmony and calling for the world revolution. While religions are against the communist teachings, we cannot deny the influence and power of this newfound cult. Perhaps it can be used as an instrument?"
 fso.106.a:0 "The Plebeian Assembly welcomes the Church."
 fso.106.b:0 "Religion is the opium for the mind!"
 fso.107.t:0 "The Church Seizes Power!"
 fso.107.d:0 "It seems that by trusting the religious snakes we simply allowed them to take the leadership from the Assembly. They have been appointing loyal, devoted commissars on important official posts for a long time now, and now they have come as far as officially overthrow us! Now the Church Committee observes all aspects of our nation."
 fso.107.a:0 "If God exists, may he help us all!"
 fso.108.t:0 "Mass Suicide!"
 fso.108.d:0 "Our continued suppression of the Church has had a positive (for us) effect! A few days ago the last few thousands of their followers have left Rio today, presumably towards the northern jungle in former French Guyana, and committed mass suicide there."
 fso.108.a:0 "Good riddance!"
 fso.109.t:0 "The Church Revolts!"
 fso.109.d:0 "Our continued suppression of the Church, it seems, have made them only stronger - and angrier! They number of followers continued to grow, and many in the military have been secretly sharing their beliefs, it seems, as today a part of our armed force declared that they will now fight for the Holy Church Committee! They seized important key structures and demand the Plebeian Assembly to turn over full control of the nation."
 fso.109.a:0 "They can try and take it."
 fso.109.b:0 "On the second thought I actually like these guys..."
 fso.109.tt:0 "§YPlay as the revolt!§!\n"
 fso.110.t:0 "Accept Our Solitude"
 fso.110.d:0 "We are alone, on our own - and we should accept it. The mood in the general populace is still rather depressive, and the Plebeian Assembly seems to be at a loss. Only time will tell how our society shall adapt."
 fso.110.a:0 "We simply don't need anyone... right?"
 fso.111.t:0 "National Defense Act"
 fso.111.d:0 "A few weeks have passed, and the depression phase has passed, giving room to acceptance and hate towards the 'foreigners' - anyone who lives in another country has abandoned us, they must hate us, they must be our enemies! Surely, they plot to attack us in the future...\nThe Plebeian Assembly decides to act preemptively, closing our borders as part of the National Defense Act. Effectively, starting today, our nation is in a permanent state of undeclared war."
 fso.111.a:0 "The whole world is out for us!"
 fso.112.t:0 "Invisible Enemy"
 fso.112.d:0 "We can close our borders, but we cannot close air itself - and our enemies will certainly listen in to our radio transmissions, as well as pollute it with their own waves. We will put in all of our efforts to create a code no one can ever crack!"
 fso.112.a:0 "Enigma? Please."
 fso.113.t:0 "The Friendship Code"
 fso.113.d:0 "Our investment paid off trememndously. Our spies report that the foreign governments are confused and concerned as they can no longer understand anything from our transmissions using the new code developed. We also developed an interesting system of 'radar' that will allow us to not relying on spies anymore at all in a not so distant future."
 fso.113.a:0 "We cannot send our own people to the hostile world."
 fso.114.t:0 "Great Wall of Czechia"
 fso.114.d:0 "The people are growing increasingly concerned with our safety from the outside world. The Plebeian Assembly has thus approved a grand project to fortify our borders, preventing any intrusion. Also planned are extensive and intricate anti-air systems, reducing effectiveness of any airborne bombardment, and the state-of-the-art radar systems are to be installed across the country, perfecting our detection protocols."
 fso.114.a:0 "We need to build the wall!"
 fso.115.t:0 "Every Man A Foe"
 fso.115.d:0 "The defense system is complete! a massive line of fortifications, trenches, pillboxes, bunkers and a lot of underground tunnels, all interconnected and spanning the entire length of the country, is certain to defend us against any and all threats from the outsiders. Anti-air points are covering the country, connected to the system of fortifications and allowing to effectively preventing any bombers from getting within reach.\nRadar stations are positioned around the nation, connected and linked to one massive computing device in Praha. There, it is located in the High Command military bunker, allowing our officers to observe actions of our neighbours and detecting troop movements.\nAll of our citizens were involved in this construction project, and when it was finally finished celebrations sparked all across the Union."
 fso.115.a:0 "They are right to celebrate, but we need to stay vigilant."
 fso.116.t:0 "People's Army"
 fso.116.d:0 "A slight problem has revealed itself in that we are lacking in the number of troops to man the borders of our nation. They are also not sufficiently prepared to defend, still reliant on our old doctrines where the words 'offensive' and 'assault' were still present. In our new nation, our army has to defend, not attack. We must rectify this - and agitate more people to join the army."
 fso.116.a:0 "We must protect ourselves."
 fso.117.t:0 "Aegis of Unity"
 fso.117.d:0 "After weeks of extensive planning, our Military Staff have come up with new doctrines, where defense is prioritised over offense, both defense of our borders and defense of our ideology. Commissars are to be established in each battallion, ensuring loyalty and providing a morale boost to defending soldiers. Offensive tactics were deemed unnecessary and redundant. We also managed to get some more people to sign up for the army."
 fso.117.a:0 "They must be ready to throw their lives at the enemy, if necessary."
 fso.118.t:0 "Industrial Might"
 fso.118.d:0 "As other countries denounced us and severed our trade, we must find a way to sustain ourselves without them. This will be a two stage plan. First, we must develop our industry and methods - we will ask our people once more to work hard and create factories which will be used to make weapons and equipment for our defense."
 fso.118.a:0 "1 year plan in a couple months?"
 fso.119.t:0 "Factories Of The People"
 fso.119.d:0 "A little miracle was achieved by our people as we have constructed great factories and roads to them. Our brilliant engineers have crafted wondrous new manufactoring and excavation technology, which ties in perfectly with our next step of the plan."
 fso.119.a:0 "The factories are welcome."
 fso.120.t:0 "Riches Of Our Soil"
 fso.120.d:0 "Czechoslovakia is already fairly rich in resources - not as much as our other European neighbours. However, our prospectors for a long time suggested that the planetary crust beneath our feet is even richer in resources, we simply lacked the technology to drill deep - until now. Massive monstrous drills are now in our posession, and we are ready to take the treasures of mother Earth."
 fso.120.a:0 "Burrowed deep, will soon be ours!"
 fso.121.t:0 "Crusty Resources"
 fso.121.d:0 "For months we were digging and drilling, creating an unmatched mines network the world has never seen before. Underground, deep below, we discovered rich deposits of steel, tungsten, chromium, ready to be delivered to our factories and fuel our war machine. However, an unexpected discovery occured. The suspicions arose when our miners started falling ill after working in the shaft 65-B. A team of prospectors in protective gear was sent out, and they returned with the report that we have stumbled in on a vein of Uranium. This element has been barely studied and other governments found it for the most part rather useless, but some of our researchers claim to have a... radical application in mind."
 fso.121.a:0 "If it can help us defend, we must use it."
 fso.121.tt:0 "We discovered Uranium.\n"
 fso.122.t:0 "Element of Harmony"
 fso.122.d:0 "Now that we have access to Uranium (or as the media have come to call it, the 'Element of Harmony'), we can allow our researchers to properly stufy its effects. This is gonna take a long time, however..."
 fso.122.a:0 "We have a lot of time."
 fso.123.t:0 "Atomic Theory"
 fso.123.d:0 "The first few months already bear fruit. Our theoretical scientists have finalised something they refer to as 'the atomic theory'. Something about how all matter consists of tiny particles that are indivisible and not seen by any means except scientific detection... What matters is that they claim Element of Harmony may be the key to unlocking some kind of 'power within' the atoms. We will see."
 fso.123.a:0 "Are we certain the money is well spent on them?"
 fso.124.t:0 "A Power Source"
 fso.124.d:0 "Any scientific theory must be proved in practice, and now our glorious engineers have created what some would consider impossible - an entirely new source of power, a 'nuclear reactor'. This top secret facility now provides power to our military infrastructure and the scientists claim that this is not the end of the possible applications."
 fso.124.a:0 "If it can create electricity, it can be used as a weapon?"
 fso.125.t:0 "How I Learned To Stop Worrying"
 fso.125.d:0 "And love the bomb! The engineers behind the marvellous new reactor have devised an explosive that used volatile uranium to unleash an immense chain reaction, causing an explosion of immense proportions - in theory. The device is not properly tested, but the Assembly has decided to link the launch pad for the rocket used to deliver the explosive to the High Command bunker. However, it seems that we have expended our resources on creating this device. To create another bomb like that we will need to use the reactor to 'activate' more uranium."
 fso.125.a:0 "Now we can truly defend ourselves!"
 fso.125.tt:0 "We have made a prototype nuke.\n"
 fso.126.t:0 "New Dawn For Us"
 fso.126.d:0 "Our people feel safe now. Safe and protected from the outsiders. The news of our new weapon using 'Element of Harmony' has inspired many to enlist and sign for the military. We will form an elite corps of 'Elements of Harmony' - devoted to the cause and to defense of our motherland."
 fso.126.a:0 "Elements of Harmony... I like the sound of that!"
 fso.127.t:0 "Dream of Unity"
 fso.127.d:0 "A new era is upon us. Something great is bound to happen, our nation is destined for it. But danger looms on the horizon, and it appears that our enemies are on the move. They hear about the element of harmony, and they tremble. Our new army is ready to take their attack!"
 fso.127.a:0 "For the Union!"
 fso.127.tt:0 "Will create 24 divisions - the corps of elites."
 fso.128.t:0 "Act Of Aggression"
 fso.128.d:0 "Today, at 08:37 in the morning, our radar system has detected an incoming massive attack force. The alarm went off, but the officer staff needs time to assemble, and the invasion force was threatening to breach our defense line and strike Praha if the decision was not made immediately. The officer on duty faced a difficult choice, but his ideological training took over. All outsiders are our mortal enemies, and they must perish. With that thought, he launched the prototype nuke at the massive enemy group detected by the radars. In less than half an hour, the threat vanished from the screens as fast as it appeared. Mission accomplished."
 fso.128.a:0 "We defended ourselves."
 fso.128.tt:0 "We have nuked one of our neighbours. Oops.\nThis will lead to grave consequences - prepare your army."
 fso.129.t:0 "European Defense Board Declares War"
 fso.129.d:0 "Our enemies outside are clearly scared of us. They used the media to play off as if the nuclear attack was directed at civilians and not in self defense. The dark clouds are gathering, and the enemy musters their forces. European wars have subsided, and the leaders have agreed to combine their military command under one entity, European Defense Board. The British Chancellor was elected the Board's leader, and we have received a formal declaration of war this morning."
 fso.129.a:0 "This will be our final war!"
 fso.129.tt:0 "Survive until 1943 or defeat your enemy to win.\n"
 fso.130.t:0 "Bloodshed Carries A Price"
 fso.130.d:0 "For many long years we have fought. Our stoicism is admirable, and our troops stand firm. However, advancing into the enemy territory is proving to be impossible. Both sides are realising the pointless waste of life. The negotiations of a white peace are offered by the European Defense Board. They agree to demilitarize the border with our nation and do not pursue us any further so long as we do not use our nuclear armaments."
 fso.130.a:0 "These are acceptable terms, they better stay away."
 fso.130.tt:0 "Congratulations, you won!\n"
 fso.131.t:0 "Glorious Victory"
 fso.131.d:0 "Against all possible odds, despite the numerical advantage of our enemy, we reign supreme, and the opposing forces have surrendered unconditionally. The entire world is now on their knees, and no one feels safe if they are not part of the Union because of our terrifying nuclear arsenal. We are masters of the world!"
 fso.131.a:0 "Submit or die!"
 fso.131.tt:0 "Congratulations, you won!\n"
 fso.132.t:0 "Albert Einstein"
 fso.132.d:0 "Our Military Intelligence reports that a foreign scientist, Albert Einstein, can help us a lot in understanding the applications of Element of Harmony... but he needs to be persuaded first. Our special operations crew has developed a plan to kidnap him for further indoctrination - shall we try it?"
 fso.132.a:0 "Yes, of course."
 fso.132.b:0 "We do not need foreign 'scientists'."
 fso.133.t:0 "Successful Operation"
 fso.133.d:0 "The kidnapping was performed just as planned, and Albert Einstein was taken from the United States. A couple of weeks in detention in our Military Intelligence headquarters was enough to convince him to help our research efforts. With his help we can boost all of our research, and we have already found a useful application of depleted uranium in our cannon rounds for more impact strength."
 fso.133.a:0 "Excellent!"
 fso.134.t:0 "Failed Kidnapping"
 fso.134.d:0 "Unfortunately, the CIA discovered our agents, and Albert Einstein was extracted into safety, and our american cell was compromised. This is a hit to our prestige, and prestige of our Intelligence."
 fso.134.a:0 "Oof."
 fso.135.t:0 "New Nations Join the Board!"
 fso.135.d:0 "We integrated new nations and their command to join the war."
 fso.135.a:0 "Yay!"
 fso.136.t:0 "Emperor's Pilgrimage"
 fso.136.d:0 "Despite the recent triumph of Dark and his loyalists, a sense of doubt and uncertainty has not abandoned him. The court gossips about the Emperor's moody attitude, and it seems often as if he is lost in thought. Those closer to Dark, however, know more. They are aware of what he told them, that he is not happy with the world as it is, uncertain of the direction he needs to take the country in, the people. 'Marxists, Nazis, Liberals, Conservatives, Centrists... none of them really hold true values', he says.\nFinally, one day Dark has decided to go on a pilgrimage to the mountains, alone, to meditate and decide what truly matters in this world."
 fso.136.a:0 "May his journey bring him wisdom he seeks."
 fso.137.t:0 "The Emperor's New Clothes"
 fso.137.d:0 "Today the Emperor Dark Buddhist returns to the capital. He brings an entirely new concept of society and a new direction for the people and his nation. 'Friendshipism', as he calls it, is an ideology that promotes friendship and kindness, balance and stability above all else. This idea is spreading quickly among the courtiers and the people alike, as it appeals to many as the one true way. The goal is clear now - we must dismantle all factions, disarm all armies, pacify all tyrants and greedy bankers, stop war and make eternal Pax Amicitiae!"
 fso.137.a:0 "Ave Caesar!"
 fso.138.t:0 "Whip or Tribute?"
 fso.138.d:0 "One of the important dilemmas Dark Buddhist encountered on his spiritual journey was the approach towards others his new ideology will take. Will it be aggressively poised against other ideologies? Or will we strive for a more peaceful approach? After long considerations, Dark Buddhist decides that..."
 fso.138.a:0 "...we need better whips."
 fso.138.b:0 "...we live and let live."
 fso.139.t:0 "Many or One?"
 fso.139.d:0 "The second dilemma Dark Buddhist faced had to do with the internal approach to society. What matters more - the common friendship of many, or the individuals in friendships? It is a very difficult choice, and both have advantages. After long considerations, Dark Buddhist decides that..."
 fso.139.a:0 "...the greater friendship matters more."
 fso.139.b:0 "...the individual friendships matter more."
 fso.140.t:0 "The Grand Embassy"
 fso.140.d:0 "One must never stop learning. It is a great wisdom for every person, and it’s twice as important for any leader. Our newly established emperor seems to be taking this life lesson quite seriously. After spending a few days alone, occasionally seen staring out of the window, he made a public announcement. Inspired by great people of the past, like Peter the Great, he too is going to travel the world, West and East, see what they do better, see what they believe in, and observe what they are best at. Let us hope it will be enough to be able to compete on the world’s stage in the future."
 fso.140.a:0 "We must stay competitive!"
 fso.141.t:0 "Return Home"
 fso.141.d:0 "Finally, the grand adventure is over. We've brought back many useful knowledges and curiosities, and learned many new things. Dark Buddhist is pleased."
 fso.141.a:0 "Good!"
 fso.142.t:0 "Perfect Friend"
 fso.142.d:0 "In his travels Dark Buddhist has come to meet or see the world's greatest leaders, and learned much about them. His wish now is to make them his friends, but for that we must plan and prepare first."
 fso.142.a:0 "We can befriend them all!"
 fso.143.t:0 "Friendship-ready!"
 fso.143.d:0 "The preparations are complete, the budget is set, the appointments are aligned, and now we can attempt to make a lot of friends!"
 fso.143.a:0 "Gotta catch 'em all!"
 fso.144.t:0 "[fso_coup_target.GetLeader] Besties Forever!"
 fso.144.d:0 "Our efforts to befriend [fso_coup_target.GetLeader] have achieved exceptional results as we have made him our best friend. He is so excited and enthralled by friendshipism that his affection gained followers already in [fso_coup_target.GetName]. A coup is planned to be executed to bring the country aligned to the image of Friendshipism."
 fso.144.a:0 "Best friends forever!"
 fso.145.t:0 "[fso_coup_target.GetLeader] Befriended!"
 fso.145.d:0 "[fso_coup_target.GetLeader] now considers Dark Buddhist his trusted, close friend, and starts growing support for friendshipism in his country, [fso_coup_target.GetName]. However, it will take some time as his followers are hesitant and not ready for war yet. [fso_coup_target.GetLeader] has assured us of their full support in the war should one start."
 fso.145.a:0 "Friendship Wins!"
 
 fso.151.t:0 "Planned Purges"
 fso.151.d:0 "In Soviet Union Dark Buddhist was inspired by the purges performed there. Now that he has returned, he wants to make a decision about doing the purges - decide the scale or if the purges are needed at all. Surely, the enemies of friendship must be removed, per say, but is it really aligned with friendshipism?.."
 fso.151.a:0 "Purge all edgelords! Everyone!"
 fso.151.b:0 "Perhaps we can only punish the most dangerous ones."
 fso.151.c:0 "I... I cannot do this."
 fso.152.t:0 "Save Target"
 fso.152.d:0 "Nobody will see this text anyway so I'll say it here: I like Hawaiian pizza."
 fso.152.a:0 "It's the best."
 fso.153.t:0 "Friendship Ruined"
 fso.153.d1:0 "Unfortunately, our efforts to befriend Stalin have failed as he's gotten upset with our actions. Moscow is now closed to us, and we'll have no Stalin's support if we want Soviets to turn friendshipist."
 fso.153.d2:0 "Unfortunately, our efforts to befriend Hitler have failed as he's gotten upset with our actions. Berlin is now closed to us, and we'll have no Hitler's support if we want Germans to turn friendshipist."
 fso.153.d3:0 "Unfortunately, our efforts to befriend Mussolini have failed as he's gotten upset with our actions. Rome is now closed to us, and we'll have no Mussolini's support if we want Italians to turn friendshipist."
 fso.153.d4:0 "Unfortunately, our efforts to befriend Roosevelt have failed as he's gotten upset with our actions. Washington is now closed to us, and we'll have no Roosevelt's support if we want Americans to turn friendshipist."
 fso.153.d5:0 "Unfortunately, our efforts to befriend Hirohito have failed as he's gotten upset with our actions. Tokyo is now closed to us, and we'll have no Hirohito's support if we want Japanese to turn friendshipist."
 fso.153.a:0 "Oof"
 fso.154.t:0 "A Dinner For Two"
 fso.154.d:0 "Dark Buddhist already sent a letter to Berlin inviting Adolf Hitler for a dinner together. It would be a lovely meeting of friends, but the choice of foods is on the inviting side, that being us. What dishes shall we pick for the Fuhrer?"
 fso.154.a:0 "Baked potatoes with a side of pasta and cake dessert!"
 fso.154.b:0 "Fish and chips, with ice cream dessert!"
 fso.154.c:0 "Pierogi, sauerkraut and jelly dessert!"
 fso.154.dd:0 "Pork beef with a side of porridge and cupcakes!"
 fso.155.t:0 "A Happy Meal"
 fso.155.d:0 "It seems that our choice of foods pleased the Fuhrer greatly, as he was rather happy that we took the time to learn his food preferences. The dinner went very well, and we've made significant progress."
 fso.155.a:0 "Excellent!"
 fso.155.tt:0 "We made progress on becoming close friends."
 fso.156.t:0 "It Went Fine"
 fso.156.d:0 "These three words can describe the dinner very well. Despite not the best choice, the Fuhrer enjoyed the food and the conversation. We've made some progress."
 fso.156.a:0 "Good."
 fso.156.tt:0 "We are becoming friends."
 fso.157.t:0 "It Went Fine"
 fso.157.d:0 "These three words can describe the dinner very well. Despite not the best choice, the Fuhrer enjoyed the food and the conversation. We've made some progress."
 fso.157.a:0 "Good."
 fso.157.tt:0 "We are becoming friends."
 fso.158.t:0 "A Disaster!"
 fso.158.d:0 "The Fuhrer was furious when he saw the dishes presented to him. He was very mispleased to be offered meat, and nothing would cheer him up for the rest of the evening. He seems to dislike us more."
 fso.158.a:0 "A sad day."
 fso.158.tt:0 "We caused distrust! Be careful!"
 fso.159.t:0 "Downtown Berlin"
 fso.159.d:0 "Dark and Adolf were having a nice stroll along the streets of Berlin, planning to visit Hitler's favourite movie theater. However when they arrived it appears that the cinema is closed today! What shall we do?"
 fso.159.a:0 "Why not watch dog fights?"
 fso.159.b:0 "Go watch birds."
 fso.159.c:0 "Go to the park and paint."
 fso.159.dd:0 "Go see hot Hitlerjugend girls ;)"
 fso.160.t:0 "Distasteful"
 fso.160.d:0 "Hitler was seemingly upset when you offered him this idea, as he despised the idea of watching dog fights. The following argument ruined the mood and Hitler left in anger."
 fso.160.a:0 "Ahh..."
 fso.161.t:0 "Pretty Birds"
 fso.161.d:0 "You went to the park to watch the birds. Hitler fed the ducks in the pond also. It was all in all a good day."
 fso.161.a:0 "We made a little progress."
 fso.162.t:0 "Old Habits Die Hard"
 fso.162.d:0 "Hitler was very excited to dust off his painting skills and gladly accepted. The day flew by as you painted a park view together. It was a lot of fun."
 fso.162.a:0 "Excellent!"
 fso.163.t:0 "Hitlerjugend Girls"
 fso.163.d:0 "Hitler was quite proud to see the pretty aryan girls parading in front of him, and you peeked them a bit together in the changing room. Perverts! But it was fun nonetheless."
 fso.163.a:0 "He still loves Eva Braun tho."
 fso.164.t:0 "Weekend in the Alps"
 fso.164.d:0 "Dark and Adolf plan a weekend together, but are not quite certain what to do while they are there. There is a wide range of options and so little time!.."
 fso.164.a:0 "Let's just go skiing!"
 fso.164.b:0 "Propose Switzerland instead."
 fso.164.c:0 "Double date, Hitler with Eva and Dark with a pretty girl!"
 fso.164.dd:0 "Visit Linz, the place of youth."
 fso.165.t:0 "Skiing in the Alps"
 fso.165.d:0 "Dark and Hitler had a good weekend skiing in the mountainous Tyrol. Fond memories are sure to stay for both."
 fso.165.a:0 "Hooray!"
 fso.166.t:0 "No Way!"
 fso.166.d:0 "Adolf exploded at the mere proposal of Switzerland as a resort. He despised Switzerland and the Swiss people, and would not hear anything about spending any time there."
 fso.166.a:0 "Ahh..."
 fso.167.t:0 "Double Date"
 fso.167.d:0 "The date went rather well, as the two couples enjoyed each other and the company of friends, and some quality time was had both in the day and the night."
 fso.167.a:0 "Funsies!"
 fso.168.t:0 "Old Memories"
 fso.168.d:0 "Linz, the city where Hitler spent a lot of his youth, is a fine city, and the two friends had a lot of fun walking its streets. Hitler spoke a lot about how he wants to retire to Linz one day, living in a house where only Eva Braun and his friends would be able to visit him."
 fso.168.a:0 "We've made great progress."
 fso.169.t:0 "Westhauptstadt Germania"
 fso.169.d:0 "Adolf has invited Dark Buddhist to check out his model of a renovated Berlin, Westhauptstadt Germania. It is an imposing model, and Hitler spent a lot of time on it with his consultants like Albert Speer. It is incomplete, however, and the Fuhrer graciously offered Dark to put a building on the model, but which building should we add?"
 fso.169.a:0 "Why building? Let's add a park!"
 fso.169.b:0 "Make a museum in neoclassical style here."
 fso.169.c:0 "Put a grotesque, moderne, curvy tower in the middle."
 fso.169.dd:0 "Maybe another column?"
 fso.170.t:0 "Another Park"
 fso.170.d:0 "Hitler does indeed like the park idea, but there are already plenty on the model, plus it does not stand out. It is kept on the table, however, and Adolf is pleased."
 fso.170.a:0 "Okay then."
 fso.171.t:0 "Perfect Spot"
 fso.171.d:0 "'A museum, yes!', Adolf says excitedly, 'That's exactly what I've been missing here! It will have exhibits of the fine arts, none of that 'modern art'!' It seems like your pick has aligned with his vision perfectly."
 fso.171.a:0 "Oh, cool!"
 fso.172.t:0 "Oh no!"
 fso.172.d:0 "You put the tower in the middle. However, as soon as you turn away from it, the tower loses its shaky balance and crashes right into the models, tearing down a good chunk of the buildings on it. Hitler almost had a heart attack, and Dark decides to retreat while it's still possible, extremely embarassed."
 fso.172.a:0 "Uh oh..."
 fso.173.t:0 "Another Column"
 fso.173.d:0 "'Another one? I suppose can't have too many', Hitler replies. You look around the model. It seems that there are indeed already a lot of columns on it. Oh well?"
 fso.173.a:0 "It works fine I think!"
