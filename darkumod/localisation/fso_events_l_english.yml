 fso.1.t:0 "Order 69"
 fso.1.d:0 "The people of Czechoslovakia have happily accepted the formation of a new nation, The Friendship Order. From all around the world people flock under the banners of a new country, seeking security and safety in these dark times. Under the leadership of Emperor Dark Buddhist, protected by his Praetorian Guard, the people feel a state of gaiety. The crowned Emperor's first decree is Order 69 - establishment of the Senate as the lawmaker body of the Order. The early days of a nation, however, are most turbulent, and who knows what time will bring..."
 fso.1.a:0 "Time will tell."
 fso.2.t:0 "Crowds Gather"
 fso.2.d:0 "The first Senate is now in session. But an unexpected issue appeared out of nowhere: a massive crowd gathered in front of the Senate, demanding to be let inside to participate!.."
 fso.2.a:0 "The Guards start letting the people inside..."
 fso.2.b:0 "Praetorian Guard starts beating the more vocal speakers in the crowd..."
 fso.2.c:0 "The Emperor graciously lets the people of the Order into the halls..."
 fso.2.dd:0 "Peetry shouts obscenities from the windows to driving the crowds away..."
 fso.3.t:0 "First Friendship Festival"
 fso.3.d:0 "Time of celebration! Emperor proclaims the first ever Friendship Festival. People are rejoiced and are having fun all across the nation! A group of military veterans approached Dark Buddhist and asked for permission to hold a grand military parade. It is all just for funsies, is it not?"
 fso.3.a:0 "It is the Friendship Festival! What could go wrong?.."
 fso.3.b:0 "Perhaps our plebs and Tribune can one up the militarists..."
 fso.3.c:0 "We must ask the crowd if they want to see the parade, first..."
 fso.3.dd:0 "Of course we allow the parade! What an excellent idea!.."
 fso.4.t:0 "International Recognition of the Order"
 fso.4.d:0 "The people seem content, however we are still ridiculed and gossiped about in other countries. To show others our friendly intentions, Emperor Dark Buddhist throws a massive party - and all the world leaders are invited! However, the Senate is split into camps, and all because they cannot agree on the main dishes for the upcoming party! The horror! It looks like the Emperor needs to step in."
 fso.4.a:0 "Tea and biscuits, obviously!.."
 fso.4.b:0 "Just let the Praetorian Guard cook something..."
 fso.4.c:0 "Sausages, pizza and Sushi for all!.."
 fso.4.dd:0 "Potatoes, bread and caviar, feed as many as possible..."
 fso.5.t:0 "The Dead Senator"
 fso.5.d:0 "During one of the post-session banquets in the Senate, one of the influential Senators was found dead on the street - it appears he fell out of one of the windows... or was this a murder? The public is in uproar, and all call for an investigation! The Praetorians secured the assumed murder scene, but whom will the Emperor appoint on such a delicate case?"
 fso.5.a:0 "Appoint a group of trusted military officers, veterans, Emperor's friends..."
 fso.5.b:0 "It is the Senate's business, let the Senate appoint investigators..."
 fso.5.c:0 "We can only trust the Praetorian Guard in this case..."
 fso.5.dd:0 "The Plebeian Assembly will appoint the investigators for this horrible murder..."
 fso.6.t:0 "The Dust Settles"
 fso.6.d:0 "The recent events forged our society and government in ways we could not predict. Now we are reaching the pivotal point of our nation's short existence, and the dust settles..."
 fso.6.a:0 "What do you mean?"
 fso.7.t:0 "Plebeian Assembly Supremacy Act"
 fso.7.d:0 "The Friendship Order has changed, and drastically so. The people, formerly supporting the autocratic (albeit fair and just) rule of Dark Buddhist, are now calling for measures to be implemented to transfer more power to the Plebeian Assembly. With widespread support and influence even in the Senate, and in light of recent events, the Assembly successfully pushed through the Plebeian Assembly Supremacy Act, giving it superiority over the Senate as the law making body. The Emperor is still formally in power, however, as the national love for him is ever present."
 fso.7.a:0 "Power to the people of Friendship Order!"
 fso.8.t:0 "Officer Corps seizes the Senate"
 fso.8.d:0 "Military influence is spread across the cities of Friendship Order. More and more people are criticizing the Senate for its divided nature, blaming more and more of daily problems on the 'lazy Senators in togas pretending to be Romans'. Playing off the nationalistic and militant tendencies of the public, the Patricii Officer Corps has seized majority in the Senate. The Plebeian Assembly is closed, and effectively now they can dictate the laws, and it appears that their definition of 'friendly' is rather perverted..."
 fso.8.a:0 "Freundschaft uber alles!"
 fso.9.t:0 "Peace and Stability"
 fso.9.d:0 "Despite the storm of recent events, the Emperor and his Guard have held onto the reins of power well enough. The Senate is functioning, Plebeian Assembly is more or less content, and the populace in general is happy. The radical tendencies are in decline, and people are now firmly believing in Friendship utopia under the visionary rule of Emperor Dark Buddhist. All Hail Emperor Dark!"
 fso.9.a:0 "Ave Imperator, Caesar invicta!"
 fso.10.t:0 "Of Liberties and Freedoms"
 fso.10.d:0 "The Emperor's attention given to the Senate has not gone unnoticed in the public. Farther and wider people are talking how great the Senate is and how noble the Senators are, how much they do for the people and the economy, protecting the nation's interests. Even the Plebeian Assembly has been cooperating with the Senate more than bickering. As a result, the Senate gained a lot more power, and the Order can now be properly called a democratic state. However, the role of Emperor Dark is still undecided under these new conditions."
 fso.10.a:0 "The Senate and People or Friendship Order are going to manifest their own destiny!"
 fso.11.t:0 "Emperor Bamboozled"
 fso.11.d:0 "The Guards allowed the people into the Senate halls under the choir of cheering crowds. The Senate, shellshocked and confused, immediately agreed to form the Plebeian Assembly, and it has gained immediate influence among the people, especially the lower class. Only time can tell what will come of this. The Emperor was greatly mispleased to learn of this."
 fso.11.a:0 "Surely the Guards should ask him first?"
 fso.12.t:0 "Bold Measures"
 fso.12.d:0 "Praetorians beat the more vocal orators down until the Emperor steps in, preventing the fight between the crowds and guardsmen. As a compromise, the Senate creates the Plebeian Assembly, which seems to have appeased the crowds enough. Regardless, there is a certain fear and minor stigma against the Guard now, and some members of our Officer Corps used this to secure personal influence, especially now that the plebs have quieted a bit."
 fso.12.a:0 "They are friends to the Emperor, it should not be an issue."
 fso.13.t:0 "Free People in a Free Nation"
 fso.13.d:0 "Benevolent as he is, Emperor Darku allows the people in. The crowds cheer and hail the Emperor's kindness. In a big ceremony the Senate officially creates the Plebeian Assembly, allowing plebs to participate in the law making process. This increased Senate's popularity somewhat."
 fso.13.a:0 "They better not forget who let them in in the first place!"
 fso.14.t:0 "Angery Doge"
 fso.14.d:0 "The cursing is so incredibly convoluted and offensive that the crowds are shocked. A few more brave ones muttered quietly "no u" and "your mum gay", but their voices are unheard. Confused crowds are just shambling around the square. Finally, the Emperor himself, escorted by the Guard, opened the Senate doors and let the people in. There, he formed the Plebeian Assembly to help the plebs represent their interests. The crowds disperse in peace and hail the wise Emperor."
 fso.14.a:0 "Peetry is a good Guard."
 fso.15.t:0 "Lenin Cake"
 fso.15.d:0 "Emperor allows the parade, however he decides to encourage the plebs to do something just as exciting. After consideration, Tribune and the plebs present their Festival attraction - a huge, massive cake with an even bigger Lenin on top! They move the cake through the streets of Prague with cheering and pony music mixed with Internationale. Crowds are ecstatic and will remember this event."
 fso.15.a:0 "The Emperor would like to get a slice of that cake."
 fso.16.t:0 "The Parade"
 fso.16.d:0 "Emperor Dark's enthusiasm inspired the veterans and officers, and they tried to make it as pompous as possible. All available military forces participated in it, and the crowds were allowed to parade alongside soldiers and military machines of war. It ended with an amazing air show of the entire Air Force. The crowds are filled with national pride now."
 fso.16.a:0 "We can direct it at our enemies!.. Wait, I thought we were friendly?"
 fso.17.t:0 "Parade Poll"
 fso.17.d:0 "Emperor privately addresses the Senate to help him solve the dilemma at hand. The Senate holds a nationwide poll asking for popular opinion of the parade. It does not really decide anything, because most people are indifferent to it. However, the Senate's popularity is now increased as they are viewed as the decisive force of action. The parade is now secondary in most headlines."
 fso.17.a:0 "The Senate? A force of action? Hah!"
 fso.18.t:0 "No Harm Indeed"
 fso.18.d:0 "Dark Buddhist allows the parade. At the festival, he attended many other events alongside of it, and although the crowds liked the impressive show of force, they were more interested in talking with their Emperor. The show of public support inspired Dark to travel more during the Festival. He has taken a great pleasure in doing so, and it is rumoured that he wants to make it a yearly occurence."
 fso.18.a:0 "The crowds, they love, they love me!"
 fso.19.t:0 "Potatoes and Bread"
 fso.19.d:0 "Being cheap products, the cooks managed to make and store lots and lots of bread and potatoes and feed a massive amount of people. The leaders of countries were also gorging on fine red and black caviar. The Soviet representatives especially were impressed with the sheer amount of bread and potatoes, and even asked if they could take a few tonnes home. Mao claimed he has never seen caviar before. Tannu Tuvan representatives, unfortunately, were forgotten about and had to be content with the same food as the crowds - however, nobody cared to notice. The diplomats seemed to have made a lot of time to meet the Plebeian Assembly members and the Tribune."
 fso.19.a:0 "They probably just shared some opinions."
 fso.20.t:0 "Sushi, Pizza and Sausages"
 fso.20.d:0 "Quality food made an excellent impression on all world leaders, however most impressed were the diplomats from Berlin, Tokyo and Rome. Emperor Darku, fascinated with Roman Empire just like the rulers of current Italy, conversed in Latin with the italian immediately appointed ambassador. Germany and soon after Japan appointed their ambassadors as well, and the rest of the world followed not long after the feast. Many words and promises of friendship of cooperation were exchanged, which visibly pleased the Officer Corps members present. Later they were quoting the Emperor on his comradery with the leading fascist powers."
 fso.20.a:0 "Germans, Italians and Japanese have a thing in common - good food!"
 fso.21.t:0 "Tea and Biscuits"
 fso.21.d:0 "A bit modest, but surely sweet, tea party held by the Friendship Order pleased the most attendees. Certainly, very much at home felt those from Britain, and the american diplomats politely supported their friends from London. Senators and diplomats talked a lot, and the latter shared a lot of wisdom and fun stories from their home parliaments. It seems that we have made a good impression on the inhabitants of Albion, as the news headlines would suggest on the following day."
 fso.21.a:0 "The Senate better not waste time on tea parties!"
 fso.22.t:0 "Praetorian Cooks"
 fso.22.d:0 "Definitely not the best choice, the Praetorians were not the greatest cooks! As such, the world leaders had to eat takeout ordered from the nearest restaurants. Luckily, the diplomats liked the presented food. To make the conference go smoother, the Emperor had decided to lead the diplomats to the restaurant closest to them. Such honour left the owners and personnel in awe, and later the word spread quickly about how close the Emperor is to the common business folk and working people."
 fso.22.a:0 "At least the world leaders were happy."
 fso.23.t:0 "Plebeian Police"
 fso.23.d:0 "The Assembly took the chance to solve this crime eagerly... perhaps, a little too eagerly. The appointed investigators brought their findings to Assembly, and the discussion that followed went well into the night. Finally, after a few days the Assembly and its investigation came to a conclusion: the senator was assassinated! In life he was a supporter of Tribune's rights, and as such the corrupt Consuls in the Senate could not allow him to live. They hired the killer, he threw the senator out the window, made it look like an accident... 'Just another act of violence by the oppressors in the Senate', they claim. The Emperor was not blatantly blamed in their statement, however he was criticized for 'allowing' this plot to go unnoticed. Both Senate Consuls resigned the following day, and are awaiting trial. The Assembly's popularity among the people is massively increased as a result."
 fso.23.a:0 "Suspicious..."
 fso.24.t:0 "Military Tribunal"
 fso.24.d:0 "The veterans' investigation proved to be thorough and dedicated. Upon completely inspecting the crime scene, talking to witnesses and analyzing clues, they reported to the Senate upon their findings. 'It is with a heavy heart we admit that he slipped on a slice of Di Giorno pizza and fell out the window', they said. 'However, we have evidence to show that the slice was left there with malicious intent by a man hired by the Tribune himself!' As this evidence they presented the money supposedly used to pay the man and the man himself - a sleazy looking fellow, who swore it was the Tribune who hired him to put the slice in the senator's room. The public is in shock. Tribune has immediately stepped down and was judged, the Assembly is furious, causing street riots over unjust accusations. The Emperor, realising the Guard alone is not going to be enough, calls on the Officer Corps to quell the riots. Military steps in and is regarded nationwide as saviours and keepers of Order."
 fso.24.a:0 "Well, their investigation seems legitimate..."
 fso.25.t:0 "The Senate's Investigation"
 fso.25.d:0 "Senatorial Board of Investigators - such is the official term for the team - is doing pretty much everything that the senators normally do - make a lot of speeches, give interviews, make a lot of noise, but they do not actually do a lot to solve the crime itself. 'It was most likely just an unfortunate accident', the official statement reads. Whether or not this is actually the case, we might never find out. However, the Senate has gained significant influence with the leverage of this 'investigation'."
 fso.25.a:0 "But what happened to the poor senator who died?!"
 fso.26.t:0 "Praetorian Investigation"
 fso.26.d:0 "Praetorians are trustworthy and competent, the Emperor considered. They conducted a thorough investigation of the event, the crime scene, interviewed all they could, but had to present a rather... Anticlimactic explanation. 'It appearts that he accidentally dropped a slice of Di Giorno pizza, and then slipped on it, which lead to him falling out the window'. Nothing happened as a result of investigation itself, but it would appear that the common folk is praising the Guard for their proffesionalism and express their belief that 'Praetorians keep us safe'."
 fso.26.a:0 "They are to be trusted."
 fso.27.t:0 "The Question of Monarchy"
 fso.27.d:0 "Glory to the people! Our transition of Plebeian Assembly into power was a success. However, the Emperor Dark Buddhist still formally leads the country. He has observed our actions carefully, weighing us. Some factions in the Assembly call for his removal as monarchy is opposed by Marxist teachings, but others wisely argue that the Emperor holds a lot of influence over the people still as their beloved symbol of friendship. The arguments in the Assembly continued, until finally..."
 fso.27.a:0 "...The radical faction won the vote! Plan the assassination!"
 fso.27.b:0 "...The negotiatiors gain the upper hand! Send the delegates!"
 fso.28.t:0 "Death of the Emperor"
 fso.28.d:0 "The murderers decided that the support of the people is enough to warrant a blunt approach without triggering a backlash. Rumours were spread that the Emperor plots to overthrow the rightfully established Assembly, and despite the Guard's and loyalists best efforts to thwart this, the belief was planted firmly. At dawn, the Palace was stormed by a massive amount of militia and the military. The Guards were overpowered by the sheer numbers and their resistance was neutralized by noon. The Emperor himself was captured in his bedroom, led out to the city square and executed under the chorus of bloodthirsty screams of the plebs. However, by the end of the day the conspirators were informed that Peetry, Emperor's brother, and the remaining Praetorians, accompanied by the remaining loyalists, fled to the south, where they gathered a potent force to 'liberate the nation from the murderous, fake news fagsies in the Assembly'. This marked the start of a civil war..."
 fso.28.a:0 "The people will prevail!"
 fso.29.t:0 "Ire of the People"
 fso.29.d:0 "The murderers decided that the support of the people is enough to warrant a blunt approach without triggering a backlash. Rumours were spread that the Emperor plots to overthrow the rightfully established Assembly, and despite the Guard's and loyalists best efforts to thwart this, the belief was planted firmly. At dawn, the Palace was stormed by a massive amount of militia and the military. However, the Guards resistance was enough to hold off the attackers long enough for the Emperor and his loyalists to escape. After the word of this reached Praetorians defending the palace, they escaped the city as well, leaving the conspirators empty handed. The crowds grumble, and worries are raised in the Assembly, although many believe that Emperor's escape only further proves his guilt. The fire of the civil war is now burning..."
 fso.29.a:0 "We will emerge victorious!"
 fso.30.t:0 "Monarchy Destroyed"
 fso.30.d:0 "The murderers decided that the support of the people is enough to warrant a blunt approach without triggering a backlash. Rumours were spread that the Emperor plots to overthrow the rightfully established Assembly, and despite the Guard's and loyalists best efforts to thwart this, the belief was planted firmly. At dawn, the Palace was stormed by a massive amount of militia and the military. Caught off guard, the Praetorians were neutralized within an hour, and the Emperor captured, as well as most loyal leaders and his brother Peetry. Later that day the Emperor was executed, crowds mixed with cheering and grieving for the loss of their Emperor. The remaining loyalists have dispersed with no real centralised opposition; all minor groups were suppressed and eliminated shortly. It seems that the transition of power is now complete."
 fso.30.a:0 "All according to plan."
 fso.31.t:0 "The Grand Conference"
 fso.31.d:0 "The negotiators launched a series of consultations with the Emperor, discussing the future of the Order with him personally and on the Assembly meetings. They were eager to discuss the teachings of Marx and Lenin with Dark Buddhist, and continually attempted to show him why they chose them. Eventually, the Emperor finally seemed to accept and see reason in the words of Assembly's finest demagogues. As a result, Dark was leaning more and more to a conclusion that the only way now for him to ensure the stability of this nation was to resign and distance himself from politics entirely, in seclusion away from the capital, surrounded by his loyal friends and supporters. While this was not quite what the negotiators had in mind, this was still an acceptable outcome to the question of monarchy, and enough to silence the more radical parties in the Assembly, and a popular option among the people, who saw the Emperor more as a formal ideal rather than a real force of power."
 fso.31.a:0 "We will keep an eye on him anyway, just in case."
 fso.32.t:0 "The Visionary Emperor"
 fso.32.d:0 "The negotiators launched a series of consultations with the Emperor, discussing the future of the Order with him personally and on the Assembly meetings. They were eager to discuss the teachings of Marx and Lenin with Dark Buddhist, and continually attempted to show him why they chose them. Eventually, the Emperor finally seemed to accept and see reason in the words of Assembly's finest demagogues. He was becoming more and more agitated and invested, and it would appear as he had started forming ideas of his own. The discussions became arguments, and through Dark's immense charisma and logic, the mentors became enthralled more in his vision of communist ideas, which Dark himself called 'Cutie-Marxism'. Finally, Dark held a speech in the Plebeian Assembly, which was broadcast by the radio across the country. He proclaimed his vision of the world as a union of friendship socialist states, explained the basics of Cutie-Marxism, and finished by accepting the Assembly leaders' invitation to lead the country as the Supreme Leader. This day will truly go down in history."
 fso.32.a:0 "The dawn of a new era!"
 fso.33.t:0 "Creeping Fear"
 fso.33.d:0 "The negotiators launched a series of consultations with the Emperor, discussing the future of the Order with him personally and on the Assembly meetings. They were eager to discuss the teachings of Marx and Lenin with Dark Buddhist, and continually attempted to show him why they chose them. However, no matter how hard they tried, these just did not sit well with Dark Buddhist at all. Worse, the intensity and frequency of invitations, discussions and meetings led to him growing suspicious and cautious. Then came allegations of dishonesty, then malicious intent, then, finally, accusations of treason. The negotiators were desperate, but it was too late. They could not influence the Emperor. One fateful day, the Praetorians stormed the Plebeian Assembly mid-session on the orders of the Emperor and demanded its closure immediately. Shaken by this, negotiators lost the initiative, while the radical factions eagerly took this as an opportunity. Militias and loyal military divisions surrounded the Senate's former building and besieged it, however, the Guards simply vanished before the encirclement was complete. The Emperor himself was long gone from the palace, and in a speech held from a radio station on the south of the country called for all still loyal to his name to gather and rally under the banners of 'true friends'. The civil war is now inevitable..."
 fso.33.a:0 "We tried our very best."
 fso.34.t:0 "Interesting Times"
 fso.34.d:0 "War! Civil war rages in our country now, and both sides are vehemently opposing one another. Let the dice fly!"
 fso.34.a:0 "We, of course, will be the victors."
 fso.35.t:0 "The Unrest Is Over"
 fso.35.d:0 "We have emerged victorious in the war, and now is the time to rebuild."
 fso.35.a:0 "Vae Victis."
